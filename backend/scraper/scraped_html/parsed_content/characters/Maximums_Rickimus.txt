After the real perpetrator, Evil Rick, was beaten to death by the group of enslaved Mortys, the Council of Ricks shows up to escort the Rick-less Mortys back to their respective dimensions. The Council takes C-137 Rick and Morty back to the Citadel, and officially apologize to Rick for accusing him of the murders.
