 Bertie is a bodyguard who worked for Cecelia. Personality: During a conversation, Bertie mentioned that she’s a fan of Mr. Poopybutthole and sympathizes with him not wanting to act anymore. However, that didn’t stop her from helping Cecelia, who wanted to imprison Mr. Poopybutthole and force him to become a celebrity again. Biography:: Bertie, along with another unnamed bodyguard, was hired to assist Cecelia. At the studio, when Cecelia was talking about her plans of forcing Mr. Poopybutthole to star in movies and commercials, Mr. Poopybutthole lied that he needed to go to the bathroom. Cecelia allowed it, but only with Bertie watching on him. In the bathroom, Mr. Poppybutthole told Bertie that he needs privacy, so she turned around for a few moments. However, she soon realized that he was trying to escape. She then heard a scream and found out Summer had appeared and was holding Cecelia at gunpoint. She ordered Bertie to kill Summer, but Bertie missed and accidentally destroyed Mr. Poopybutthole’s hat instead. With his hat gone, Cecelia no longer saw any value in him. Summer then used the Portal Gun so she and Mr. Poopybutthole can go back to Earth. Appearances: Lil’ Poopy Superstar 3 Lil’ Poopy Superstar 4
