Antenna Morty is an alternate version of Morty with two green antennaes on his head. Biohgraphy: He was one of the slaves captured by Evil Rick and Morty and held in their base on Hideout Planet. He ultimately teamed up with the other Mortys to take down the Rick and his Crab Spiders. His dream is "to write really crazy, intense action novels". Afterwards, he was escorted back to The Citadel with the rest of the stolen Mortys. He later attended one of President Morty's speeches, as seen in "The Ricklantis Mixup", in front of a Morty statue.  Appearance: Antenna Morty is a young Caucasian teenage boy with short brown hair and a yellow shirt. He looks identical to most Mortys, except that he has two green alien-like antennae on his head. Episode Appearances: "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind" "The Ricklantis Mixup" (cameo) "Unmortricken" (cameo) Trivia: Antenna Morty is depicted as a character in the Rickstaverse unlockable "Morty Tracts". His antennas bear a resemblance to Shrek, of the DreamWorks Animation film and franchise of the same name. Site Navigation:
