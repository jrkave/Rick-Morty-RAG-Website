Eric Stoltz Mask Morty is an alternate version of Morty Smith who originates from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz Mask people. He was assigned to be Doofus Rick's Morty since Doofus Rick never had any son or daughter. He appeared in "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind" playing cards with other Mortys. Eric Stoltz Mask Morty is a member of the Citadel's militia. In The Rickshank Rickdemption, many Mortys are killed when the Citadel of Ricks is transported into a prison of the Galactic Federation, it is unknown if Eric Stoltz Mask Morty is one of the Mortys who died. Trivia: With Doofus Rick being assigned as his Rick, it is assumed that an Eric Stoltz Mask Rick is dead. The concept of this Morty having an Eric Stoltz "mask" is a reference to how Eric Stoltz played the role of Rocky Dennis, in the movie Mask, by putting on a mask that made him look as though he had craniodiaphyseal dysplasia. It's also a reference to Eric Stoltz being the actor originally cast to play Marty McFly in Back to the Future, before being replaced by Michael J Fox.
