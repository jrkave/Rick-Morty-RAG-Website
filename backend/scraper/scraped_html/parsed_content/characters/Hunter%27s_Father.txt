 Hunter's Father is a minor character that appears in the episode The Ricks Must Be Crazy. He works as a police officer who responds to a call of Rick's ship causing violence when it's set in "Keep Summer Safe" mode. His only son, Hunter, drowned in 1996 at the age of only 7 years old. He blames himself for his son's death, and Rick's ship uses this to its advantage by briefly recreating his deceased son in an act of psychological warfare.
