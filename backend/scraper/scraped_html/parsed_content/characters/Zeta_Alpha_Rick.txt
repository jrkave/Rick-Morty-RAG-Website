Appearance: Zeta Alpha Rick shares the general appearance of Rick Sanchez, though with a different hairstyle. Biography:: In "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind", Zeta Alpha Rick appears alongside his fellow council-members, Rick Prime, Maximums Rickimus, Quantum Rick, Riq IV, and Ricktiminus Sancheziminius, accusing Rick C-137 for the murder of 27 alternate Ricks, including The Scientist Formerly Known as Rick. He joined them in sentencing Rick C-137 to the machine of unspeakable doom, to which he steals a portal gun and escapes from the Citadel. After the real perpetrator, Evil Rick, was beaten to death by the group of enslaved Mortys, the Council of Ricks shows up to escort the Rick-less Mortys back to their respective dimensions. The Council takes C-137 Rick and Morty back to the Citadel, and officially apologize to Rick for accusing him of the murders. They even offer him a coupon for a free Morty, should anything ever happen to his, which Rick accepts while Morty's back is turned. In "The Rickshank Rickdemption", the Council of Ricks hold Morty and Summer captive after sending SEAL Team Ricks to assassinate Rick C-137.

Rick infiltrated the Council chamber and kills most of the Council of Ricks, killing Zeta Alpha Rick with a shot to the head before ending up in a standoff with Riq IV, ultimately killing him and wiping out the council.
