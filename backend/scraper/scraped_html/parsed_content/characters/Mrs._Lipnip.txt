Mrs. Lipnip is the wife of Joseph Lipnip, and the mother of Thomas Lipnip. She appeared in "The ABC's of Beth". Biography:: The original Mrs. Lipnip presumably became a Cronenberg in the Cronenberged dimension. In "The ABC's of Beth", Rick and Beth sent Tommy's Clone to her house, to make her think her real son was alive and in good health. She bought the bait and went to her husband's execution, to present the evidence that he didn't kill his son, just in time to save him and reunite the family. Trivia: Oddly enough, she was at home, while her husband's execution was in the process. Why she would not be present, during the impending death of her husband is weird. However, it can be justified with the fact that she, along with many others assumed he killed her son, so she was probably just mad at him and didn't want anything to do with him from then on.
