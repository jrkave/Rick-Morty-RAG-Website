 Lawrence Maps was a citizen of 41-Kepler B. He is known for being the ex-husband of Amber, as well as the first suicide victim shown in "That's Amorte". Biography:: Several years after her break up with Fred, Amber married Lawrence Maps, and changed her surname to Maps. The couple had two children, one son and one daughter. However, after meeting Fred again and falling in love with him, Amber decided to divorce Lawrence. Lawrence became devastated over this, and killed himself decades later. As a spaghetti person, his body produced spaghetti due to the cortisol caused by the suicide, and Rick brought him to Earth so his spaghetti could be eaten by the Smith Family. Morty became outraged after finding out about this, and demanded to go to the victim’s funeral. Several people were gathered at Lawrence’s funeral, including his two children, but none of them spoke about him. Morty then stood up to confess his action of eating the spaghetti from his body, admitting that it was delicious but that it felt wrong to not have anyone know about the incident. His speech was filmed and that led to suicide spaghetti becoming a popular product. Trivia: Since their last meeting with Lawrence, Fred and Amber had their looks changed significantly due to decades having passed. Lawrence, however, had his appearance only slightly changed in comparison.
