The Klthakkkath’pft’torp Mind Collective, preferably known as David Prime, is a Hivemind appearing to primarily have taken control of Boobloosians. It posted a clickbait article online entitled, "We Joined a Hive Mind, Here's Why You Should Too", which was designed to attract naïve humans with "mind altering-docu-tech", and assimilate them.
