Churry is the animate churro that appears in the episode "Rickfending Your Mort". Background: In a flashback from "Rickfending Your Mort", Morty asks Rick to make a churro come to life. In a montage from the same episode, Morty and Churry are seen bonding, and after some time Morty asks Rick to turn Churry back into a churro. Rick explains that that is not possible, as Rick had to make Churry "functionally immortal" for him to be alive. To get rid of Churry, Rick and Morty planted regular churros in a desert planet, and brought Churry there in the disguise of bringing him to his family. When Churry realizes what they did, he saw them flying away and yelled that he will also leave Morty on a deserted planet "Praying for death". At the end of the episode, Morty became paranoid that Churry returned especially to find a churro in his school locker. He then saw a message in brown sugar, implying Churry returned to Earth.
