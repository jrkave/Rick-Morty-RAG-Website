Lizard Rick is a lizard person-version of Rick seen climbing walls at The Citadel. Biography:: He first appeared in the Season 3 premiere episode, "The Rickshank Rickdemption", and can be spotted crawling on the walls of the Citadel. It is unknown what happened to him following the fall of the Galactic Federation and near destruction of The Citadel.  He later makes a cameo in "Rickmurai Jack" in Rick C-137's flashback, where he appears on the wall with many photos of many Ricks belonging to the future Council alliance, including himself. Rick C-137 later went on a rampage killing those Ricks, but considering he remained alive many years later, Rick either lost him in his blind rage or the Lizard Rick seen in the show is just an identical character.
