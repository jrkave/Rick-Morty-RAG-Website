 The Larvaalians are an alien species that was part of the Galactic Federation before its fall. Their home planet was destroyed by Cromulons.  History: Their planet was involuntarily transported to Signus 5 Expanse to be a part of the interdimensional cromulon TV show Planet Music. Their representatives performed after Arboles Mentirosos and before Earth. They were not declared the winners and their planet was destroyed by a plasma ray. One larvaalian attended the wedding of Birdperson and Tammy on Planet Squanch. Behaviour: Larvaalians are a very disliked species and thus, nobody was sad about most of them being dead. They are capable of creating "gooey and foul-smelling" milk and they enjoy squirting it at other aliens as a prank. Appearances: "Get Schwifty" "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate" "The Wedding Squanchers" Trivia: So far only one member of this species had a speaking role with that member being a surgical assistant at St. Gloopy Noops Hospital.  This member is identified as female due to having an uncredited female voice actress. References â†‘ 1.0 1.1 Rick and Morty Character Guide page 73
