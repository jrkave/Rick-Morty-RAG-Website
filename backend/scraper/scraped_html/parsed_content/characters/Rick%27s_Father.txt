Rick's Father (known only as Mr. Sanchez) was the father of Rick Sanchez. His name is unknown and he has never been seen in the show. He was mentioned in the episode Auto Erotic Assimilation. Appearance: It is unknown exactly what Rick's father looked like, but general appearance can be gathered based on what the identical aliens looked like. Ricks's father apparently had glasses and short combed-over hair. He most often wore a white button up with a blue tie, a belt, grey pants, and brown shoes. Biography:: In the episode "Auto Erotic Assimilation", Rick and Unity were going to have an extremely kinky sex orgy, which involved multiple different things. One of Rick's requests was so that "Every man that remotely resembles his father would watch." Trivia: It's unknown how Rick truly feels about his father, considering he is rarely brought up. Whether the reason that Rick wanted men at the orgy stems from his relationship with him or if it was just to fill a sick sexual fantasy is unspecified. Given that Tycoon Rick's full name is Rick D. Sanchez III, his version of his father was possibly named Rick Sanchez Jr.
