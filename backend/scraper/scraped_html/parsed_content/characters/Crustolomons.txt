 Crustolomons are large purple four-legged spider-like aliens with four crab-like claws, seven eyes and a vertical mouth. Their bodies are covered by a purple shell. Every ten seconds they make a snickering sound, and they are capable of speaking english. In the episode Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind, Evil Rick and Morty use these creatures as henchmen for keeping all the Mortys prisoner. References â†‘ Rick and Morty Character Guide page 61
