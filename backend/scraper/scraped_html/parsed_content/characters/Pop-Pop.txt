 Pop-Pop was the late grandfather of Jerry Smith who exists in the afterlife with his wife Nana. It is unclear whether he was on the side of Leonard Smith or Joyce Smith. In "Mort: Ragnarick", when Rick Sanchez was repeatedly killing and reviving Jerry to research the afterlife, Pop-Pop had came out to meet Jerry 7 times off-screen, but stopped after that because it was getting annoying.
