 Glenn was a one-off character who appears briefly in the Pilot episode of Rick and Morty. He and several of his comrades are shot and killed by Morty during a gunfight at interdimensional customs under the deception of Rick Sanchez that Glenn and his species were robots. Biography:: While Rick attempted to hack a portal back to their home dimension, he ordered Morty to shoot at the guards to buy him some time. While Morty was initially reluctant to shoot at the guards, Rick claimed that the Gromflomites were "just robots" and that it was "okay to shoot them." Morty was horrified when he shot Glenn and saw that he fell down in agony and began bleeding, realizing that he was in fact not a robot. While Glenn bled out, one of his comrades shouted for someone to "call his wife and children," adding another dimension of twisted tragedy to Glenn's untimely demise. Trivia: Youtuber Dead Sound created a fan-video prominently featuring the background and history of Glenn, with specific notice to his previous work and his family. The video adds a possible and, as of yet, non-canon level of depth to Glenn's character. Glenn is the first confirmed (possible) victim of Morty. Site Navigation:
