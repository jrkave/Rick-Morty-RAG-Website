Katherine Heffelfinger is an unseen girl that was mentioned in the episode "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate". Apparently, Morty has some kind of romantic interest in her and is possibly friends with her. Morty has a problem, where he was texting with Katherine, but after a while, she stopped returning his texts, which came as a huge problem to him. Biography:: The original Katherine might have became a Cronenberg in the Cronenberged Dimension. In the episode "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate", Morty had a huge rage out, and he lashed out at Summer, going on a tangent about how TV producers don't care about her feelings, and would rather make their media interesting instead of inoffensive. Rick responded by saying "Jeez, Morty. I take it Katherine Hefflefinger hasn't texted you back yet?" to which Morty responded, saying "I don't wanna talk about it." Trivia: Katherine is Morty's third love interest in the series, following Jessica and Annie. Heffleinger spelling is used in the English subtitles, Heffelinger elsewhere (note spelling in Biography: section above).
