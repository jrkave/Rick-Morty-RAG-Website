Rick Guilt Rick was a presidential candidate in the Citadel Election in "The Ricklantis Mixup." His character is designed to resemble Jimmy McMillan, a politician affiliated with the "Rent is Too Damn High Party," a populist political organization based in New York state. He can be seen in a side room, along with Retired General Rick, during the scene where the bodies of Ricks killed by Evil Morty's order are being loaded up in the airlocks to be disposed into space. It's unknown if he was present and died during the destruction of the Citadel or left it and survived his likely demise.
