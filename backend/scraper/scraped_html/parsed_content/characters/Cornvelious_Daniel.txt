 Cornvelious Daniel was the Galactic Federation agent tasked with obtaining the formula for inter-dimensional travel from Rick Sanchez's brain. He served as an antagonist in "The Rickshank Rickdemption". History: In "The Rickshank Rickdemption", The Galactic Federation used a machine called the Brainalyzer to send Daniel inside Rick's brain to gather information about Rick's portal gun. Daniel succeeded in convincing Rick to show him his memory of him inventing the Portal Gun, which also included Rick's wife, Diane and their daughter, Beth, are killed by a bomb. Daniel scanned what he thought was the formula for the Portal Gun, but actually sent a virus to the mission control which gave Rick full control over the Brainalyzer. As Daniel was explaining that it wasn't possible since details of memories can't be altered, Rick revealed that the memory they just witnessed was completely fabricated by him. Rick then transferred himself into Daniel's body and began his quest to destroy the Galactic Federation. Daniel's consciousness was left behind in Rick's body as a result of Rick's stealing his own, and was presumably killed when the Brainalyzer was shut off; if not, he most certainly met his end when SEAL Team Ricks stormed the Galactic Federal Prison and Rick D-99 shot Rick's body in the head. Trivia: Rick's lines when he possesses Daniel's body were also dubbed by Nathan Fillion. The actor reportedly had to down a few beers in the recording booth to emulate Justin Roiland's signature burping for Rick. Merchandise:
