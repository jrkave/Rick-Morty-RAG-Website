Rainbow Suspenders Guy is a reoccurring background in Rick and Morty. He characterized by his colorful suspenders, and is portrayed in the background as anything from a human chair in chair world, to an anti Trunk Person activist. Appearance: Rainbow Suspenders Guy appears as a Caucasian male with big, poofy, blonde hair. He wears a yellowish, stained shirt, and blue pants. Holding up his pants are his famous Rainbow Suspenders. In the center of his shirt is a picture of a football with Roman numerals as laces. He looks very similar to Rainbow Shirt Morty, who is likely a reference to him. It should also be noted one of his ears is much larger than the other. Purpose: Rainbow Suspenders Guy was originally going to be a mechanism to crossover both Gravity Falls and RaM. This was confirmed in a podcast where Alex Hirsch and Justin Roiland explained they were originally going to have 2 Rainbow Suspenders Guy in each show, and when combining each football shirt Roman numerals, it would spell “confidence” in Roman numerals. This idea was eventually scrapped, for Gravity Falls ended much before Rick and Morty had time to add the joke.
