 Magnesium-J is an Alphabetrian royal figure of a castle on Alphabetrium. He served alongside Hydrogen-F and Helium-Q to govern the planet.  Biography:: The Alphabetrians turned Water-T into Ice-T when he refused to care about anyone, and banished him from their world. He would only be able to return if he learned to care about other people. After Ice-T helped save Earth from the Cromulons, he returned to his home planet to meet with the elders. Magnesium-J and his fellow elders had heard of Ice-T's feat and welcomed him home. Magnesium-J decided that Ice-T's exiled could now end, and granted him back his original form. This was immediately followed by the Numbericons attacking Alphabetrium, causing a large rock to fall down on Helium-Q and kill him. Water-T drew his guns and charged the Numbericons to avenge his father's death. Episode appearances: "Get Schwifty" "Rise of the Numbericons: The Movie"
