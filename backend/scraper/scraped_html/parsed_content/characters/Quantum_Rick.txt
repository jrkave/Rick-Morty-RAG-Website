Quantum Rick was one of the six members of the defunct Council of Ricks. History: This Rick was a member of the Council of Ricks, who at one point tried to sentence Rick C-137 after he was framed for murder. Rick C-137 would later take revenge on the entire council, including Quantum Rick, who was either murdered by Rick or managed to escape whilst Rick C-137 assumed his identity.  Rick C-137 wore a black bodysuit and had places for weapon storage under Quantum Rick's robe, while nearly the entire council carried no weapons and wore brown pants, meaning that Rick C-137 took Quantum Rick's robe, gloves, and boots, only, and altered his hairstyle. Appearance: Quantum Rick shared the general appearance of the titular Rick Sanchez but sported a puffier hairstyle.
