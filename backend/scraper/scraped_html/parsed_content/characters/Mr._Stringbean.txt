Mr. Stringbean is a character who briefly appears in the Season 6 episode “Analyze Piss”. He is one of several wacky villain characters who appear in the episode, all of whom try to get a rise out of Rick. Biography:: Mr. Stringbean confronts Rick shortly after the latter chose to ignore the strange goofball villains that regularly accosted him, where the scientist promptly disregards his rhyming taunts. They are soon met by another cheesy villain, Doctor Buckles, where the two begin to fight over the right to harass Rick. As Mr. Stringbean trades blows with Doctor Buckles, Rick merely moves along. Appearance: Mr. Stringbean is a green, limbed, sentient stringbean with a distinguishable mustache. He wears long black gloves over his hands and has the ability to shoot foes with the beans within himself. Personality: Mr. Stringbean is shown to be obnoxious when he confronts Rick and insults him in rhyme for seemingly no reason at all. He is also incredibly prideful, where he immediately went to fight upon being called out by Doctor Buckles. Relationships: Mr. Stringbean attempts to confront Rick for seemingly no reason, most likely trying to get a rise out of the scientist like the other villains before him. He taunts Rick using rhymes, referring to him as a “giant piece of shit”. When Rick ignores him, he continues to try and goad him into a fight until Doctor Buckles shows up. When Doctor Buckles arrives, presumably for Rick, he demands that Mr. Stringbean chill out. Angered, Mr. Stringbean attacks and proceeds to battle Doctor Buckles, possibly getting the upper hand just as Rick leaves. Trivia:   References
