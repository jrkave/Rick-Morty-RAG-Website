Jesus Christ has a cameo appearance in Rick and Morty as a caricature of Himself on a story-train constructed entirely of a literal story device. Biography:: This version of Jesus is based on the religious figure found in the Christian Bible. Whilst He seems to possess the same power of His Biblical counterpart, as well as many more not found within the book, He remains unique due to the fact that He's aware of His existence as a purely fictional interpretation.  Appearance: Jesus' appearance seems to stem from His stereotypical appearance from both religious paintings and interpretations found within pop culture. As such, He wears robes, which cover His incredibly muscular body, as well as fair skin, long flowing hair and a beard. This Jesus was introduced into a story by Rick, so it could be assumed His appearance is also based on how Rick interprets Jesus. Personality: Relationships: Appearances: Trivia: The phrase "Jesus Christ", as well as euphemisms such as "geez", are frequently used as expletives by various characters across Rick and Morty media.
