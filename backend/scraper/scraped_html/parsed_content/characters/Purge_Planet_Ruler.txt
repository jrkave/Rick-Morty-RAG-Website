The Purge Planet Ruler was the unnamed, rich, greedy, sadistic headmaster of the Purge Planet who appeared in the episode "Look Who's Purging Now". He was a selfish and snobbish rich who only cares about himself, his family and all the money he gets. He lives in an extremely luxurious mansion, while his poor people live in an Amish country and he has an organized yearly purge, where everybody has one day where all laws are disabled and everyone can kill each other in a free for all. Rick, Morty, and one of his poor people (Arthricia) broke into his mansion one purge night and they killed him, for his horrid ways of running their country and they overthrew him, to keep their country in a safer place.
