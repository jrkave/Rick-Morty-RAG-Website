Glenn is a character portrayed by an actor in a movie from another dimension. He appeared in the episode "Rixty Minutes". Glenn is a guy who is obsessed with eating shit. He thinks it's delicious and eats it all the time as though it were food. He did this until an angry woman who is most likely his mom or his wife came up with a court order, saying that he can no longer eat shit. In the dimension where he comes from, shit is apparently a deep blue.
