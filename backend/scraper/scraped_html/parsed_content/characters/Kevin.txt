 KevinÂ was a Zigerion simulation technician working for the scammer Prince Nebulon. He died in the explosion onboard the Zigerion ship after they "scammed" Rick Sanchez. Biography:: Kevin was an unassuming Zigerion who was often picked on for his nerdy disposition. Kevin was directly responsible for researching human nudity which, which caused him to be picked on even more due to the Zigerion population's discomfort towards the subject. He worked on making the simulation especially made for Rick Sanchez, which resulted in the creation of a lifelike Morty simulation. Kevin evidently fought real hard to supervise the designing of Morty's genitals. After Rick figured out he was in a simulation and dragged a naked Morty with him into the school showers to talk safely away from the spying Zigerions, Kevin was suggested to be the one to check up on them until they got dressed again. After the third and final simulation ended, he steered the little hovership with Prince Nebulon and other Zigerions over to Rick. One of his coworkers revealed to Rick that Kevin enthusiastically supervised the simulation of Morty's genitalia, much to Kevin's embarrassment. He died soon after when their ship exploded, as a result of Rick's "recipe" for concentrated dark matter.  Trivia: While all other Zigerians have two tentacles, Kevin is the only one with four, an ode to the old adage of those with glasses being called "four eyes"
