"Wait, you thought that's all you needed to do to get your portal gun back?It's not going to be that easy, Rick. I don't even have it." "Come back when you have 6 badges and maybe you'll be closer." : Appearances: "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind" "The Rickshank Rickdemption" Pocket Mortys Trivia: It's unknown why he would name himself after a Rick who murdered his wife and gave him access to portal technology, unless that Rick's nickname was not as common amongst other Ricks.
