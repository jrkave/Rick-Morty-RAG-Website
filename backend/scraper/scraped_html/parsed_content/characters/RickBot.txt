 Rickbot was a robot created by Rick after Morty decided to take the sword in A Rick in King Mortur's Mort. He was made to be 22% more thoughtful than his creator to make a replacement for him while he was in search of Rick Prime. He is voiced by Justin Roiland. Appearance: Before being destroyed by Summer, Beth and Space Beth after finding out he was a robot, he looked exactly like our Rick. After that, his head got cut off along with other limbs that were used as christmas tree decorations. Eventually, he got rebooted to look like a cyborg whose every part is robot except most of the head, both hands, and half of his right arm. His right eye is orange except for the default red and the body color is gold instead of silver. Personality: RickBot was a lot kinder and thoughtful than his real counterpart. Although it wasn't said if 22% is a lot or not, the percentage that Rick hates Morty would make him cry so we can just assume that 22% is a lot. He knew exactly what to give everyone on christmas, even as far as giving Morty a lightsaber which the real Rick would never do. He often wanted to kill himself which he eventually succeeded. He also pretended to not be a robot even after everyone already found out. Relationships: RickBot and Morty's relationship was closer than with the real one by 22% although he was programmed to be so. Before he died, he always wouldâ€™ve  always given the emotional support needed to make Morty feel better. Although Morty was suspecting that RickBot was a robot from the start it didn't stop their friendship. When Morty couldn't stop himself from crying after agreeing to cut off his penis, he was the one to let him hug it out.
