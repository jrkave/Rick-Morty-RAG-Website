Joyce Smith is the wife of Leonard Smith, the lover of Jacob Philip, the mother of Jerry Smith, the sister-in-law of the Unnamed Uncle, the mother-in-law of Beth Smith, and the paternal grandmother of Summer Smith and Morty Smith. With her husband's consent, she takes a man named Jacob as a consort due to her husband's impotence. Biography:: Joyce made her first appearance in the episode "Anatomy Park", where Jerry wanted to have a traditional Christmas holiday and kept pushing his family to be lively for when his parents visited. She and Leonard visited the Smith family for Christmas. They also brought along a man named Jacob with them. They explained to their son Jerry that Jacob was a motivational man who lived with them to help bring joy back into their marriages. Jacob's main purpose was to have sex with Joyce on account of Leonard's impotence. Leonard would also watch them doing it from a closet, and according to him, almost always dressed as Superman. Jerry was shocked and he felt very miserable. He ended up hating his parents for this. She was also complimentary to Jacob when he helped Summer's boyfriend Ethan with his emotional issues. It is likely that in the Prime Dimension, Joyce has either died or become a feral survivor, along with her husband, after the invasion of the Cronenbergs.
