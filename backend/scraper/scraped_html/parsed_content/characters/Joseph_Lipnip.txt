Joseph Eli Lipnip is a man, who was falsely accused of eating his son, Tommy, when he was trapped in Froopyland, by Beth, when she and Tommy were children. The original Joseph Lipnip presumably became a Cronenberg in the Cronenberged dimension. He is nearly executed when Tommy's clone shows up and he is declared innocent. Its unknown what happened to him after that, but it is suggested that he was released from prison and went back to his wife and "son". He appeared in "The ABC's of Beth".
