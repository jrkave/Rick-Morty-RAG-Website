Mr. Poopybutthole's Dog is the pet dog of Mr. and Mrs. Poopybutthole. It appeared in "The Poop in My Pants". Biography:: During their move into their new apartment, Mr. and Mrs. Poopybutthole supposedly adopted a dog and a cat from an animal shelter, indicated by the "Who Saved Who?" sticker and kept them as pets. The cat and dog got along quite well as friends, until the sad day, when the cat passed away. The dog was just as sad about it as The Poopybuttholes, but was cheered up, when he heard that Mr. and Mrs. Poopybutthole would be having a baby.
