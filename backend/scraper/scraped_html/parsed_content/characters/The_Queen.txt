 The Queen is the main antagonist of “Rick and Morty Issue 17”. History: King Stephen, who was one of Rick’s friends, married an unnamed person who became The Queen. Rick Sanchez heavily disagreed with the decision but Stephen did not care about it. The Queen turned out to be a tyrant, who became the sole ruler of her planet and imprisoned Stephen. Rick heard of this and decided to rescue the King and send him an “important letter”.  Rick was aware of how germaphobic her species was, so he injected the galaxy’s worst diseases into Morty and brought him to the planet. The duo encountered the Queen and her bodyguards. They managed to destroy Rick’s portal gun, but ran away after finding out about Morty’s diseases. The duo managed to free King Stephen from his cell, but they were all quickly found by the Queen, who threatened to imprison Stephen for another hundred years. She was wearing artificial skin and had two bodyguards wearing hazmat suits. The Queen picked up a rocket launcher and shot three missiles, but Rick dodged one of them and used his sentience weapon on the other two, who became intelligent and decided to run away and get married. Rick stabbed Morty’s dick and cut open the Queen’s artificial skin, leaving her vulnerable. Morty then vomited into the Queen, and she melted to death. Her guards decided to just side with the King again. Trivia: When consummating the marriage, she wore three artificial skins. Stephen described it as like he was “making love to an onion”.
