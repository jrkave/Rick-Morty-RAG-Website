Jeff is one of the many people Summer matched with on Lovefinderrz. He was about to be married when they met, but then matched with someone else and went off with them instead. Biography:: The original Jeff presumably became a Cronenberg in the Cronenberged Dimension. Jeff downloaded Lovefinderrz on the day of its release, which paired him up with Summer. The app later broke them up, when it paired Jeff up with Maggie. Jeff and Maggie arranged a wedding in a church and were about to be married by Priest Witherspoon when Lovefinderzz abruptly paired him up with Summer again, who came parachuting in through the church window. The two embraced and Jeff asked the priest if he could marry them instead. Immediately after, he got a new match with Richard, who came charging into the church on his motorcycle, and the two drove off together. At the end of the day, everyone deleted the app when Glootie activated a paywall, and broke themselves free of the curse. Trivia: Jeff is likely named and modeled after writer Jeff Loveness, who co-produced the episode "The Old Man and the Seat".
