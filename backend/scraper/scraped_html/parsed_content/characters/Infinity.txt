Biography:: Oxygen-S first appears when Water-T calls him about the "I" of Harmony. Oxygen-S asks Water-T about his coordinates and promises to send help. But he sent the coordinates to the Numbericons.  When the spaceship with the Numbericons and the Emperor Dread Nought landing on planet E-10, Oxygen-S reveals his true form to Water-T, Mr. Goldenfold, Sulfur-P and Morty Smith. Other Numbericons help him and he becomes an 8. 8 takes the "I" of Harmony and becomes Infinity. He destroys the Emperor Dread Nought and flies to kill the Alphabetrians. On Alphabetrium, Infinity kills both Alphabetrians and Numbericons. Sinistar-7 tried to stop him, but Infinity destroys her spaceship.

Force ghost Magma-Q appears and turns Water-T into Magma-T. Magma-T turns the "I" of Harmony into a golden gun and kills Infinity.   Appearance: As a Alphabetrian, Oxygen-S is a large capital S composed entirely of oxygen.  In his natural form, 8 is a big red number eight covered in a triangular pattern. Infinity appears as a large infinity symbol covered in fire.  Personality: Infinity is a cunning, manipulative character. Being an 8, he probably hated his own species as much as he hated Alphabetrians. When he received the "I" of Harmony and became Infinity, he became blinded by his power.
