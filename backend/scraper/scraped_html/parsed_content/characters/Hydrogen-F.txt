Hydrogen-F is an Alphabetrian who is a letter F made out of hydrogen. She is a royal figure of the Alphabetrian empire along with Magnesium-J and Helium-Q. Biography:: The Alphabetrians turned Water-T into Ice-T when he refused to care about anyone, and banished him from their world. He would only be able to return if he learned to care about other people. After Ice-T helped save Earth from the Cromulons, he returned to his home planet to meet with the elders. Hydrogen-F and her fellow elders had heard of Ice-T's feat, and granted him back his original form. This was immediately followed by the Numbericons attacking Alphabetrium, causing a large rock to fall down on Helium-Q and kill him. Water-T drew his guns and attacked the Numbericons to avenge his father. Episode appearances: "Get Schwifty" (no lines) "Rise of the Numbericons: The Movie"
