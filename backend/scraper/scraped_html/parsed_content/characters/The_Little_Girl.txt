The Little Girl was featured in the Centaur's dream, which was in Pancakes' dream, which was in Mr. Goldenfold's dream. She jumps rope while singing about Scary Terry. Rick and Morty intercepted her dream, which turned out to be exactly like where they already were. After they escaped their dream, Scary Terry decapitated her, causing her to wake up. Inspiration: The rhyme she chants is based on 1, 2, Freddy's coming for you from the Nightmare on Elm Street films about Freddy Krueger, upon whom Scary Terry is based. The girl is based on various unnamed girls seen in the film series, alternatively referred to by descriptions such as Elm Street girls or jumprope children. References â†‘ Lawnmower Dog DVD commentary
