 Mr. Frundles is a parasitic creature referred to by Jerry C-131 as a "Boogen." While undeniably cute, Mr. Frundles is actually incredibly deadly. Once exposed to an open environment it will infect all things both living and inanimate by biting them, turning them into another version of Mr. Frundles, and very rapidly taking over the entire world and consuming its resources. Rick Sanchez kept it as a pet because he thought it was cute despite knowing the risks. It was accidentally unleashed on Dimension C-131 by Jerry C-131 in "Solaricks". After biting that Jerry and turning him into a Mr. Frundles parasite, it took over the entire world in mere seconds, forcing the whole family to move to the Parmesan dimension. Trivia: Mr. Frundles' mode of infection greatly resembles a Grey Goo Apocalypse Scenario, complete with it infecting inanimate objects, as well as living things. Mr. Frundles continues the tradition of Rick and Morty characters having a "Mr." title and frequently introducing themselves by saying "I'm Mr...". Other examples include Mr. Meeseeks, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Mr. Nimbus. The show's own animations demonstrate that Earth C-131 was not permanently uninhabitable after the Mr. Frundles event, since a future of the planet being inhabited by dolphin people was mentioned in "A Rickle in Time" and shown in "Mortyplicity". It is possible either that there was intervention from a divine being like the Time Cops, or Goddess Beth, depending on their power scaling versus Mr. Frundles.Because of the discrepancies between the cataclysmic event and the visually animated future, this can be considered a plot hole if this was unintentional.
