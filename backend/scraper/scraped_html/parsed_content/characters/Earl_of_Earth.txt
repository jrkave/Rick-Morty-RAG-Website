 The Earl of Earth is the royal representative of the planet Earth. His appearance strongly resembles Santa Claus, though he seems to be unaware of the concept. History: He originated on Earth and could be a human, but that’s unconfirmed as he uses the term “Earthling” instead. As a part of an interplanetary tradition, he cut off one of his body parts as a sacrifice, gained immortality and later became the Earl of Earth. After the Sons of the Moon started attacking the Sun, the Earl of Earth and the representatives of several other planets reunited in the Neutral Zone to discuss the conflict. The Earl questioned Morty’s claim about being the King of the Sun, claiming he looked like an earthling. Morty confused him with Santa, but the Earl made it clear he has no idea what that means. When Morty revealed he has the Solar Scepter, a war started between all planets as their rulers tried to get the object so they could rule the Solar System. During the war, The Earl was crucified on one of the planets, but survived thanks to his immortality. After the Knights of the Sun used their powers to send peace signals throughout the Solar System and Rick brought the Scepter back to Earth, everyone stopped the attacks and Solar War One ended. Trivia: He is the topic of discussion due to the ambiguousness over him being Santa or having connections with the latter.
