 Beta-Seven is a Hivemind who has a planet near Unity's Planet and trades with Unity as part of an alliance. Beta-Seven seems to want to be seen as more than an "ally" to Unity; when Beta-Seven first meets Rick, it appears to be jealous of his relationship with Unity, and begins stammering when Unity confronts it about screeching at Rick. It is suggested that after Rick and Unity break up again. Rick grew depressed, and tried to kill himself. Beta-Seven now may have a closer relationship with Unity. In a post-credits scene Beta-Seven prevents Rick from seeing Unity, saying that Rick is classified as a hostile entity, and that Unity does not wish to speak with him.  While Unity returns in Air Force Wong, Beta-Seven isn't mentioned implying that Unity broke up with it sometime later.  Trivia: Beta-Seven is a parody of the Borg, fictional alien race from the Star Trek franchise. The Seven in its name may be a further reference to Seven of Nine, an ex-Borg character in Star Trek: Voyager. Beta-Seven's name is likely a play on the term "Beta", a slang term for a male who is considered less manly than normal, is weak-willed, and/or has a hard time communicating with women. The point-and-scream Beta-Seven performs when Rick slaps him on the back is a reference to the Pod People from Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
