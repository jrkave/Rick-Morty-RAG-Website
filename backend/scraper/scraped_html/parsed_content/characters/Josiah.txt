The original Josiah presumably became a Cronenberg in the Cronenberged dimension. Josiah is a construction worker, who fell victim to the Lovefinderrz app and started dating Priest Witherspoon on impulse. Josiah makes a brief cameo in Forgetting Sarick Mortshall, where he is fixing a power line but is attacked by crows causing him to fall out of the cherrypicker.
