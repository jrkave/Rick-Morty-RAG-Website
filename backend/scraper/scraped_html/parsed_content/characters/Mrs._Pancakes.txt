Mrs. Pancakes is a character from a TV show called The Days and Nights of Mrs. Pancakes. Mr. Goldenfold has a crush on her. He oftentimes dreams of being with her. Rick stated that he also watches the show, but was a full season behind at the time. Biography:: She appeared in the episode Lawnmower Dog, where Mr. Goldenfold dreamed that she was an airplane stewardess, and that she would fall in love with him. The dream was interrupted by Rick and Morty disguised as terrorists, threatening to blow up the plane. A passenger has a breakdown and kicks down the door to the plane, sending everyone flying outside. As they were falling, Rick and Morty noticed she had a parachute and held onto her. Before she could finish uttering her catchphrase, Rick violently knocks her out with a blackjack, and he and Morty incept her dream, where she is the queen of an S&M room. Rick and Morty later return to the pleasure chamber after incepting the dreams of the Centaur, the Creepy Little Girl, and Scary Terry. Scary Terry kills her in her dream and she awakes, astonished. He then shapeshifts into a rocket and kills Mr. Goldenfold, who was lying in a pink heart shaped bed, apparently ready to have sex with Mrs. Pancakes.
