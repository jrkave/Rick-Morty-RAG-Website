Ants in my Eyes Morty is a Morty that was owned by Rick Sanchez (C-594). He was accidently killed by Morty Smith (C-594) when the other Morty ripped out Ants in my Eyes Morty's Morty Manipulator Chip. Just like Ants in my Eyes Johnson, he couldn't see on account of the ants in his eyes, and he also couldn't feel.
