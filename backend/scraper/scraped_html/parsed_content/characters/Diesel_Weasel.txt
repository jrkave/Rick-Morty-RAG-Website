Diesel Weasel is an evil mutant Weasel who causes acid rain. Personality: As Rick notes, Diesel Weasel has little in the way of characterization. He enjoys creating clouds of acid rain because he wants to make people suffer, regardless that gains nothing from it. He appears early on in "A Rickconvenient Mort" but is only seen once as a minor antagonist.  Trivia: He is based on the Captain Planet villain Verminous Skumm, a rat-man who pollutes cities out of misanthropy. He bears a strong resemblance to the Biker Mice from Mars, another cartoon that was on at the same time as Captain Planet.
