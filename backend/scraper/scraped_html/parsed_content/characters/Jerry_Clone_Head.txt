 Jerry Clone Head is a horrific cloned head of Jerry Smith created by Rick Sanchez in "Rattlestar Ricklactica" Biography:: When Jerry attempted to lie to Beth after he accidentally lost his shoes that Rick made gravitational, Rick pieces everything together and freezes Beth with a remote. He tells Jerry he's going to help him out since it's Christmas, but Jerry refuses and hangs up the phone. Rick turns on a machine in his lab that creates a DNA sample of a horribly disfigured, fungus verison of Jerry's head and uses the sample to get Beth to believe Jerry is okay (but he almost gives himself away). Afterwards, he's sprayed with acid, killing him.
