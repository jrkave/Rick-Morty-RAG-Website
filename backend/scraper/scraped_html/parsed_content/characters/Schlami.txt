The Schlami is a species of alien creatures from another dimension. It appeared in the episode "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate". Little is known about their species, except for the fact that one of them works in a factory for making Plumbuses. Their job consists of rubbing the dinglebop and then spitting on it, after it has been pushed through the grumbo.
