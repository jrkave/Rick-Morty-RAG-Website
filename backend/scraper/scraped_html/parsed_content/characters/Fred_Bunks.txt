Fred Bunks was a citizen of 41-Kepler B. He volunteered to be killed so the spaghetti trade would stop.  Biography:: Fred studied in the same school as Amber, and the two became lovers. However, in their adult years, Fred moved to a distant place so he could enroll in college. He and Amber remained in an unstable long-distance relationship. After failing in his subjects, Fred’s life went downhill, and he had a one-night stand in a nightclub. Fred then felt remorse and confessed it to Amber, and the two broke up. He then decided to move in with his parents again, and they welcomed him. They passed away when Fred was in his middle age. While trying to revive his dreams of being an architect, Fred invented the 41-Kepler B equivalent of Lego (which he called Fredblox), and it became a success. While browsing on social media, Fred came across Amber and contacted her. After meeting at a restaurant, the two fell in love again, and Amber later divorced her current husband so she could marry Fred. The two lived the rest of their days happily married, and Amber was the first one to pass away. After the discovery of suicide spaghetti, Madame President legalized and encouraged suicide so more spaghetti could be made and sold. Although he was in horrible pain and only had two more months to live, Fred refused to euthanize himself, as he didn’t want to support such a cruel system. However, he and Rick decided to collaborate on a plan to end the spaghetti trade for good. Rick took Fred to a chamber where, in his last moments after pressing the euthanasia button, Fred displayed the memories of his life on a screen, with Rick broadcasting it to the entire world. After watching it, everyone lost their appetite for spaghetti, instead finding it disgusting.
