 Nerd Rick was an alternate version of Rick Sanchez who sports stereotypical buck teeth and glasses. He was killed by Disheveled Rick while hunting down Rick Prime during the events of "Unmortricken". Following his death, Evil Morty harvested some components from Nerd Rick's cybernetic upgrades for parts to upgrade his and Rick's Portal Gun to allow them to escape Prime's trap.
