 Rick Sanchez of Dimension J19α7, commonly referred to as Doofus Rick, is a very little respected Rick. He never had any children of his own, and so was assigned a Morty from a reality where everyone looked like Eric Stoltz from the movie "Mask". He has a secret friendship with Jerry Smith (C-132) where once a month they have a Jerry and Rick's Day of Fun to spend time together. Personality: Rick is a kind and gentle Rick who genuinely cares for Jerry, and considers him his best friend. He sees Jerry as the son he never had, and wants to spend more time with him, but doesn't want to steal Jerry away from his family. He is easily impressed with various things that Jerry does, like printing t-shirts with their faces on them. Rick enjoys rollercoasters, the zoo, flying with jetpacks, playing ball, taking goofy pictures, and drinking alcohol (particularly with Jerry). He appears to be less intellegent than all of the other Ricks, but he has recently discovered a cure to cancer in his own dimension. Trivia: Because of how similar Dimension C-132 is to Dimension C-131, Rick (J19α7) is an exact replica of Rick Sanchez (J19ζ7) to mirror Jerry C-131's friendship with a Doofus Rick. Like Doofus Rick, this Rick never had any children of his own. Like Doofus Rick, this Rick also has an Eric Stoltz Mask Morty.
