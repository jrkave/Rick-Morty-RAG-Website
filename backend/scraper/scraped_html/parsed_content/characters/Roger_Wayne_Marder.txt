 Roger Wayne Marder was a citizen of 41-Kepler B. History: Spaghetti People have their organs turned into spaghetti after committing suicide. Madame President made a business out of this, encouraging her citizens to kill themselves so they can become food for other species. Roger, who was a serial killer and cannibal, heard of this and consented to being eaten as a retribution for his crimes. He committed suicide and the spaghetti produced from his body was sold in cans. Rick bought one and showed it to his family. The can had a hologram of Roger talking about his life.
