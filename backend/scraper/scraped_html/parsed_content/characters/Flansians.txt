The Flansians are an alien species who appear in the background in the Rick and Morty universe.  History: A Flansian couple was at Nuptia 4 for marriage counseling before Beth and Jerry Smith's mythologs broke out of their cells and went on a murderous rampage. Another couple were present at the wedding of Birdperson and Tammy on Planet Squanch before being gunned down by Galactic Federation agents. Biology: Flansians generally have yellow scaly skin and a large head with one very big eye. They have two long thin legs, and their equally long and thin arms end in hands with three finger. Despite their scaly skin, the female Flansians do grow large amounts of hair on their head, and both genders wear clothes.
