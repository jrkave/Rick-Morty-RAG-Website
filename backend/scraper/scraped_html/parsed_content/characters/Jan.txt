Jan is a writer for Citadel Toyz, LLC., and the creator of the Story Train and Story Lord. He first appeared in Full Meta Jackrick, where he was used in Story Lord's plot to siphon motivation.  Biography:: Jan was working for Citadel Toyz LLC. when the company produced the Story Train toy. However, the product failed, which seemed to lead to the company's collapse. Only Jan appeared to be left when Story Lord shows up after escaping the Meta Reality and starts making demands. Jan reveals he believed the entire concept to be flawed from the beginning, and that it wasn't his fault Story Lord failed. Despite this rant, Story Lord kidnaps Jan to use in his quest for motivation. Jan seems to be willing one way or another to help Story Lord, as he is willing to push the heavy wheel powering Story Lord's motivation array. When Rick and Morty arrive, Morty is able to convey the words of Joseph Campbell to convince Jan to give up on writing and helping Story Lord. After Rick manages to defeat Story Lord, the duo convinces Jan to smother Story Lord with a Rick plushie, much to the writer's dismay. Appearances: Trivia: Jan's inspiration and likeness is that of Dan Harmon, the creator of Rick and Morty. It is unclear whether Citadel Toyz, LLC. is located on the Citadel of Ricks or not. Morty previously states that he bought the train from a vendor on the Citadel, but the Citadel the audience is aware of at this point had been destroyed by Evil Morty at the end of Season 5.
