 Nana was the late grandmother of Jerry Smith who exists in the afterlife with her husband Pop-Pop. It is unclear whether she was on the side of Leonard Smith or Joyce Smith, though presumably it's the former, due to her possessing Jerry's facial features. In "Mort: Ragnarick", as Jerry was being experimentally killed by Rick Sanchez for the 8th time, Nana came out to greet Jerry in the afterlife, but Pop-Pop was not with her that time because he was tired of Jerry dying and being revived over and over.
