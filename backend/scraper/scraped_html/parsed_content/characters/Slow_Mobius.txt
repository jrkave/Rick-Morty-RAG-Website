Slow Mobius was an uncle of Rick Sanchez, who first appeared in the episode "Ricksy Business". He had the ability to slow down time with a pair of giant clock-headed time wands. He is voiced by Chris Romano.  In "Unmortricken", Rick Prime uses the Omega Device to kill him in all realities, erasing him from the infinite multiverse. Appearance: Slow Mobius was a green, pale-skinned, alien of a humanoid appearance. He was short, stout and wrinkly, with his face resembling Rick's, with the same shape mouth, an elongated nose and giant eyes, but he also had some warts on his head. He wore a cosmic suit that has a clock on the front of it. He also wore a band around his head with a clock on the front of it. Personality: Slow Mobius had a fun-loving and comedic personality, shown when he slowed down time around Morty when the latter saw Jessica at the party, continuing to do so until Rick noticed and berated him for the clich√©. He seemingly was a good husband to his wife, judging by her deep grief towards him after his passing.   Appearances: "Ricksy Business" "Unmortricken"   Trivia: Although the creators have stated multiple times before that Rick will never mess with time, because of all the problems it could cause, Rick was seen telling Slow Mobius to speed up time while he was doing The Rick Dance. Likewise, Rick did freeze time in the next episode in order to clean up the house. It's uncertain what Slow Mobius and Rick's relation means for the latter, as it may indicate that Rick is partially an alien on a genetic level, and so are the other members of the Smith family, excluding Jerry.It can, however, be assumed that he's simply Rick's honorary uncle, as he considers him part of the family.
