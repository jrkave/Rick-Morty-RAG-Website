The Traflorkians are a species of small green aliens. They are often seen performing various jobs throughout the universe, and Rick Sanchez has befriended a lot of them. History: According to the Galactic Federation, Traflorkians came to Earth thousands of glaagnars ago and planted bones and fossils all over the planet as a goof, meaning that dinosaurs never existed. They were involved in a series of conflicts with the Pizarians called the Marinara Wars, where the Traflorkians' God Emperor Pahpahj’han consumed millions of Pizarians. Rick Sanchez invited a great number of Traflorkians to his house party. Culture: Traflorkians is a species known to goof around, particularly after they planted bones and fossils on a primitive Earth as a joke to lead humans into beliveing dinosaurs used to roam the planet. "Glip-Glop" is a derogatory term for Traflorkians, described by Rick as "the N-word and the C-word had a baby, and that baby was raised by all the bad words for jews." Rick is quoted saying, "WHAT UP MY GLIP-GLOPS!" when the Traflorkians arrive, further proving its parallels to the N-word. Appearances: "Ricksy Business" "Mortynight Run" "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate" "The Wedding Squanchers" "Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender" Trivia: The Traflorkians somewhat resemble the Lumpy Space People from Adventure Time. Glip-Glop was used as the name of a meta-fictional alien character in Season 6, Episode 8 of Dan Harmon's, Community, and as the name for the alien bartender in Season 4, Episode 2 of Mr. Show with Bob and David, for which Dino Stamatopoulos of Starburns Industries was a frequent writer.
