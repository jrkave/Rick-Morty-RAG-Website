 Rurtaugh was an IDEA (Intergalactic Drug Enforcement Administration) agent who was sent with a group to take down the "Penp Pimp" on Flarbellon-7, he was also the husband of Dora. He was killed by a Meeseek with a rope. Biography:: Rurtaugh was sent to Flarbellon-7 under the orders of Sergeant Miggs on a mission to take down the new drug lord Rick Sanchez, only known to them as the Penp Pimp. The IDEA had found Rick's location after they captured one of his Meeseeks, which he used to distribute his drugs without being traced. After they had surrounded Rick's hideout, Rurtaugh and another Gromflomite brought forth a battering ram to break down Rick's door. Rick used his Meeseeks Box to create a huge group of meeseeks to fight off the gromflomites while he, Morty and Summer ran off. Rurtaugh was killed by a Meeseek using a rope in the commotion. Personality: Rurtaugh was obviously a very skillful IDEA agent seeing as he was sent to ram down Rick Sanchez's door, effectively putting him in the first line of duty against the drug lord. He was, however, taken by the horde of meeseeks who stormed out Rick's hideout to kill everyone. Rurtaugh was also a loving gromflomite, dedicating his last words to request for someone to tell his wife that he loved her.
