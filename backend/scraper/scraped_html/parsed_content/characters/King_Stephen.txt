 King Stephen is the royal ruler of the Germaphobic Planet, as well as the husband of The Queen. History: King Stephen married an unnamed person who became the Queen. Rick Sanchez, who was his friend, heavily disagreed with the decision but Stephen did not care about it. The Queen turned out to be a tyrant, who became the sole ruler of her planet and imprisoned Stephen. Rick heard of this and decided to rescue the King and send him an “important letter”. Rick was aware of how germaphobic the King and Queen's species was, so he injected the galaxy’s worst diseases into Morty and brought him to the planet. The duo encountered the Queen and her bodyguards. They managed to destroy Rick’s portal gun, but ran away after finding out about Morty’s diseases. The duo managed to free King Stephen from his cell. Stephen was paranoid and tried to attack, but quickly recognized Rick and was happy to see him. The Queen arrived with her artificial skin and two bodyguards wearing hazmat suits. She used a rocket launcher and shot three missiles, but Rick dodged one of them and used his sentience weapon on the other two, who became intelligent and decided to run away and get married. Rick stabbed Morty’s dick and cut open the Queen’s artificial skin, leaving her vulnerable. Morty then vomited into the Queen, and she melted to death. Her guards decided to just side with the King again. Stephen praised Rick for saving him, but was quickly let down after he opened Rick's "important letter", which unleashed mini fireworks that formed the phrase “I told you so - Rick”.
