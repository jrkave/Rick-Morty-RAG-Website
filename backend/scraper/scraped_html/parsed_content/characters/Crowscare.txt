 Crowscare is a sentient scarecrow and Rick's arch-nemesis during his Rick and Two Crows phase. He was the former partner of the two crows but they get back together, much to Rick's consternation. Appearance: Crowscare's opening appearance differs from his actual one. In the opening, he is shown as a massive and frightening scarecrow, with sharp teeth, glowing eyes and tusks. His actual appearance is much less formidable-looking. He has the straw hat and green robes, but has no teeth or tusks. Appearances: "Rickmurai Jack" Site Navigation:
