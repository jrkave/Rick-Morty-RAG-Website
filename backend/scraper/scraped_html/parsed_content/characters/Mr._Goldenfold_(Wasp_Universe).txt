Larva Mr. Goldenfold is the version of Mr. Goldenfold that exists in the Wasp Universe. Biography:: He is first seen being dined on by the Smith Family, screaming as they feed on him. He begs them to simply kill him, but his pleas are ignored, as they torture him by eating his eye and pouring acid on him before he gives birth to three larvae. Not wanting them to suffer, he frantically orders them to run, but they are promptly eaten by Wasp Morty. He continues to scream, while Rick Sanchez notes on how he doesn't have it bad with his family. Trivia: He shows that not all residents of the world are wasps. He confirms Wasp Rick's words about the wasps eating their prey alive.
