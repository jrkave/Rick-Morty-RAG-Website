 Pickle Rick is a version of Rick Sanchez first seen in a teaser for Season 3 of Rick and Morty. He appears in the episode of the same name and makes a cameo appearance in Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat in a death crystal vision. Appearance In this form, Rick's only functional body parts are his brain, ears, eyes and a mouth. In all other regards, he became an ordinary pickle. He is vulnerable to dehydration and can be damaged (Although replacing a lost portion with an ordinary pickle just left a scar when reverting back to human form). Changing back to human is only possible with the help of an Anti-Pickle Serum. Two augmentations were shown in the episode Pickle Rick: Pickle Rick with Cockroach Limbs - Rick is first seen wrapped up in cockroach limbs that twitch when Rick presses a part of their brain with his tongue. Pickle Rick in Rat Suit - Constructed of rat limbs and brain, this form of Pickle Rick is very nimble and demonstrative of a level of athleticism not often seen from Rick.
