 Pussifer is one of Rick's enemies during his Rick and Two Crows phases in Rickmurai Jack. He appears in the anime opening as one of the villains. Rick stabs him shortly after his introduction in the episode. Appearance: Appearances: "Rickmurai Jack" Trivia: Rick stabs Pussifer by using the Body Replacement Technique from the Naruto anime. When Pussifer is distracted by Morty, Rick teleports behind Pussifer, leaving a wooden log in Pussifer's hand. It's unknown if he actually died from his wound or not due to his body disappearing out of frame after he was stabbed by Rick. He is not seen amongst the dead bodies in the tavern after he falls out of frame. Due to his alien biology, we do not know if the blow Rick dealt to him hit any vital organs or if it was merely a fleshwound that he could crawl away from. Pussifer's design is a reference to Jackalman from Thundercats, sharing the same shoulder armor, fur color, armor, and loincloth color. Site Navigation:
