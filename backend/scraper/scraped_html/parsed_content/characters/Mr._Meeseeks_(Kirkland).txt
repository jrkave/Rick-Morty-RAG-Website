 Mr. Meeseeks is a Kirkland-brand Meeseeks that has red skin and doesn't seem to enjoy helping others. Appearance: Mr. Meeseeks is similar in appearance to his on-brand counterparts, with the same body-type and head-shape. Unlike Mr. Meeseeks from a Mr. Meeseeks Box, he has dull red skin, middle-parted strawberry-blond hair, small patches of white body-hair, and facial hair to match. He seems to have the same facial features, but his default expression is a frown and his eyes have dark bags. Mr. Meeseeks was created holding a lit cigarette in his left hand. As only one Kirkland-brand Mr. Meeseeks has been seen, it is unknown if they are all identical, or if they have unique traits like the on-brand Meeseeks' hairstyles. Personality: Kirkland Meeseeks doesn't seem like he cares about fulfilling a request or helping others, unlike the blue on-brand Meeseeks. He appears disaffected and uninterested, and how well he completes jobs, or the lengths he will go to complete them, is unknown. History: Kirkland Meeseeks was only seen in Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat, where he was summoned by Rick C-137 (inhabiting a Wasp Rick clone) in demonstration, after realising that Morty stole all his on-brand Mr. Meeseeks Boxes. He asked "What do you want?" and blew smoke in Rick's face. Presumably, Rick gave Mr. Meeseeks an easy job offscreen, and Mr. Meeseeks vanished after completing it. Trivia: It is unknown if existence is pain to him like the original Meeseeks. This is a reference to the real life brand owned by Costco, Kirkland Signature. He holds his cigarette in his left hand, while on-brand Meeseeks are right-handed. On-brand Meeseeks grow body- and facial-hair when aged, so it is possible that Kirkland Mr. Meeseeks was created already partially aged due to a defect in the creation process.
