 Clone 5617B was one of the two clones of Spaghetti People created by Rick Sanchez. History: Madame President refused to stop the spaghetti trade because doing so would kill the global economy, but she was open to alternative ways of producing the spaghetti. Rick and Morty had an idea: Create clones of spaghetti people and indoctrinate them into believing that becoming spaghetti is their destiny. Clone 5617B and an unnamed male clone were the first and only clones, but after finding out why they were made, they escaped, refusing to accept their fate of becoming spaghetti. The two were in love and decided to kill each other in a mutual murder-suicide, as doing so wouldn’t produce spaghetti. After their deaths, Morty suggested creating clones that are less intelligent.  Trivia: Rick compared the clones’ life to the novel “Never Let Me Go”, which is about clones that are raised solely so they can die and have their organs donated for other people.
