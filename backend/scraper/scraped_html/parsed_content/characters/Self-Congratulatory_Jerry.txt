Self-Congratulatory Jerry is one of the mythologs of Jerry Smith. He appears in the episode "Big Trouble In Little Sanchez". When Jerry says "Beth, it's me, your husband. I'm here to save you, or my name isn't Jerry Smith!" Beth's new mental image of egocentric Jerry comes marching out of the mytholog machine. Trivia: When the muscular Jerrys and the mytholog Jerrys are fighting the Self-Congratulatory Jerrys do nothing but just shake hands and congratulate making them totally useless. Site Navigation:
