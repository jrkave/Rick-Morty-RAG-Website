Rick Sanchez of the Parmesan Dimension is an alternate version of the original Rick that appeared in Solaricks. Biography:: At some point in "Solaricks", Rick, along with his entire family, managed to save their dimension from Mr. Frundles before dying from "natural causes". Shortly after, the titular Smith Family arrives to the this dimension and bury the corpses of the native Smith Family. They then live out their lives in their places. He, along with the rest of the Smith family from this dimension, appear to be decaying, as if they have been dead for quite some time. Appearances:  Trivia: Assuming that the Unity seen in "Air Force Wong" is native to the Parmesan Dimension, it appears that Parmesan Rick also hunted Rick Prime at one point.
