Pencilvester is a false character, portrayed by the Memory Parasites in the Season 2 episode Total Rickall. History: He is an anthropomorphic pencil who is apparently great lifelong friends with Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith. Rick loves him so much, that he was hesitant to kill him, even giving the chance to tell him of a bad memory when he still knew he was an Alien Parasite and tearfully had Morty do it for him while looking away. Morty also loves him so much, that he refused to kill Rick in front of him, although when Rick had told Morty to kill Pencilvester the latter didn't hesitate to shoot him through the chest.  Trivia: His voice sounds a lot like SpongeBob, who is voiced by the same voice actor.
