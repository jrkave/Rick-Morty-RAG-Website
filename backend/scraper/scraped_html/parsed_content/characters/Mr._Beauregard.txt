 Mr. Beauregard is a minor character in the episode Total Rickall. History: As with many characters in the episode, Mr. Beauregard is a persona created by the Memory Parasites. Mr. Beauregard is the Smith family butler, saving the family and Cousin Nicky when they are captured by a Nazi. Dedicated to his butler duties despite his retirement age, he supports the family in extraordinary ways: from helping Jerry dislodge himself from the stair railing, to stepping-in as Morty's date for a dance. Mr. Beauregard is killed by Rick after the Smith family begins to weed out the parasites. Appearances: Mr. Beauregard also appears on the opening scene of Season 2 episodes during the pillow fight scene. Trivia: Mr. Beauregard parodies the titular family butler of '80s sitcom Mr. Belvedere.
