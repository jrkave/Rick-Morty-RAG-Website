Mortimer "Morty" Smith (C-132) is the one of the two main protagonists (alongside Rick) of the first two volumes of theÂ Rick and Morty comic series. He is the son of Jerry Smith and Beth Smith, the younger brother of Summer Smith, the grandson of Leonard Smith, Joyce Smith, Rick Sanchez and Mrs. Sanchez, the great-grandson of Rick's Father and a unnamed woman, and the great-nephew of the Unnamed Uncle. Morty is often forced to his grandfather to tag along on his various misadventures. Morty attends at Harry Herpson High School along with his older sister Summer. This Morty was somewhat similar to the mainstream Morty, but did diverge on some personality and historical details. Biography:: Personality: The Morty Smith who live in the Dimension C-132 is shown to admire and care for his grandfather Rick (maybe even to a greater extent than his Prime counterpart). And is always considerate about their adventures together, rather than complain. He mainly just follows given orders from his grandfather Rick. Morty (C-132) while similar to that of Morty Prime, did have minor differences in history and character. While the mainstream Morty had a Gazorpian son born from an alien sex robot in "Raising Gazorpazorp", this Morty never conceived a son, simply making him "Morty Smith" in contrast to his Prime counterpart who is called "Morty Smith Sr." Morty (C-132) previously knew Scary Terry even before issue 5. This must've been reflected from the second episode of the show, in which most cases, a similar event took place and Morty kept obvious memory of him. In issue 3, Morty was assumed by his father Jerry, to be blaming himself for Rick being left behind in the maze. This is fairly different from Morty Smith Prime, considering he never blamed himself for his grandfather Rick's disappearance 14 years ago. This Morty also already knew about the existence of other Ricks and Mortys prior to issue #5.
