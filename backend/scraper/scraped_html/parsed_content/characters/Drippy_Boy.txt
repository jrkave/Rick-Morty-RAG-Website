 Drippy Boy was a science golem created by Rick Sanchez. Biography:: Drippy Boy was created by Rick to show Morty real science. He then ordered Drippy Boy to clean up his mess, since Rick had thrown Morty's baking soda volcano. Afterward, Drippy Boy asked Rick what he should do now. Rick informed him that it didn't matter what he did as their lives were insignificant to the universe and they were just born to die.  Shortly after, Drippy Boy accompanied Rick to the Spatio 5 Culus' ship to rescue Beth Smith. In order to give Rick more time to sabotage the ships, Drippy Boy decided to hold them off himself. He decided if life was fleeting and meaningless, he'd rather die a hero at least. He created a makeshift sword and held them back until the ships exploded. His last words were "I love you alllllllll!" Appearance: Drippy Boy appears as a purple goo mass. He also wears black shades. Appearances: "Rick and Morty Issue 26" Site Navigation:
