 Delta is the AI inside Summer's phone in Summer Meets God (Rick Meets Evil). Personality: Delta shares some traits with his original identity, Jerry. He is akward, but really cares about his family (in that case, Summer). He doesn't seem to remember being human, as he asks if humans have dreams. Relationship: Summer and Delta meet during a night the teenager was spending with Toby. Delta notices that the latter was on the phone with his girlfriend for a while, so the AI askes if he can bring Summer back home. She accepts and he hacks the system to take over the car. The two bonds. Summer develops a one-sided crush and wants to have sex with him (with Morty being disgusted). Of course, she doesn't know Delta is part of her own father's conscience. So, when she finds out, she is also disgusted. On Delta's point of view, he eventually manages to find Jerry and merges back with him. He reasures his counterpart that he was a good father, which leads Jerry to take the full control over Gotron and obliterates whatever captured him.
