Bigfoot is a character featured in the episode "Mort: Ragnarick". At some point, Rick Sanchez found Bigfoot and trapped him in a Pok√© Ball, bullying him because Rick found his lower intelligence funny. As a way to enter Valhalla, Rick freed Bigfoot and allowed himself to be killed. Feigning remorse for the act, Bigfoot tricked Morty into freeing him, killing the teen, before he began trying to kill Rick's Operation Phoenix backup body. When the clone escaped, Bigfoot pursued it into a Norwegian city where he was taken captive by the Pope's operatives. Forced to kill for the Pope, Bigfoot was sent against other religions and atheist institutions before being given a gauntlet that would let him speak and set free. Tracking down Rick and Morty to the Smith Residence, Rick was able to convince Bigfoot to stand with them against the Pope only for the three to be repeatedly killed by the Pope's now infinite energy. Bigfoot called in other monsters to help them only for the group to be killed just as easily. Rick arranged for the other monsters to be left behind while the vikings of Valhalla shut down the energy relay, allowing him to trap the Pope in the "Popey Ball". In the aftermath, though Bigfoot wished to join human society, Rick and Morty tearfully released him back into the wild. Appearance: Originally, Bigfoot had a large, bulky body with fanged teeth. However the Pope would destroy this body. When he first escaped Valhalla back to the living, Bigfoot was put into a cloned Summer body, which was also destroyed. Afterwards, Bigfoot returned several times into a new human male body that was fairly tall and muscled. Trivia: During the events of "Air Force Wong", Fleeflak attempts to warn Rick about Bigfoot killing him only for Rick to dismiss the warning.
