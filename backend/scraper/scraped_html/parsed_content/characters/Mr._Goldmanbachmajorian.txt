 Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian was Rick Sanchez's neighbor in his original world of Dimension C-137. History: After the deaths of Diane and Beth, Rick dove into an alcoholic spiral in this quest for revenge against the Rick who murdered them, preserving the destruction in his garage and creating an AI of Diane to "haunt" him. He also forced the entire dimension to become stuck in a time loop of the day they died, too absorbed in his nihilistic behavior to realize or care that the time loop did not account for aging, and the residents of the dimension, including Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian, were doomed to repeat their actions over and over as they got older. After noticing Rick's return in "Solaricks," Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian knocked on the door to show Rick one of the notes he had left for himself over the years, revealing what was going on in the time loop. Rick was surprised to learn Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian was still alive, and felt a little guilty upon learning why. Taking in Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian and his neighborhood's condition, he realized that he had held on to the deaths of Diane and Beth for too long and dragged others like his former neighbors into it. Deciding it was time to move on, he turned off the time loop. Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian promptly keeled over and died, much to his relief. Trivia: It is unclear if a Mr. Goldmanbachmajorian exists in the Prime Dimension, Dimension C-131, Dimension 5126, or the Parmesan dimension, although given he dies immediately after Rick shuts off the time loop, it stands to reason he has long been deceased in those worlds. "Goldmanbachmajorian" appears to be a portmanteau of a number of famous people or organizations that start with "Gold": Goldman Sachs, Christian Goldbach of Goldbach's Conjecture, and one of the many organizations named "Goldmajor".
