 Judge Observer is the main antagonist of "Rickfending Your Mort". He was summoned to analyze the crimes of Rick and Morty and decide their fate. History: The Observers put Rick and Morty on trial after they accidentally killed the Audit Observer. A judge, a prosecutor and a lawyer were summoned to review moments of Rick and Morty’s adventures, to decide if they are good or evil. To allow him to defend himself, the Observers allowed Rick to access their technology, and he used it to play a clip of him being a leg, much to their annoyance. The Judge condemns Rick and Morty to execution, but Rick is able to cancel it as he still had control over the courtroom. Rick claims that, while he’s not innocent, the Observers are not any better, and uses his device to play clips of them refusing to help a drowning alien, selling pirated movies and paying homeless aliens to fight. The Judge claims that only some of them are bad, and one of them brings up that the Judge slept with Tom’s wife, Nancy. The Judge proudly asserts that he doesn’t regret it, saying Tom could never see how much of a treasure Nancy was. Tom angrily attacks the Judge and kills him, prompting a massive fight between all Observers. Rick and Morty use this opportunity to escape.
