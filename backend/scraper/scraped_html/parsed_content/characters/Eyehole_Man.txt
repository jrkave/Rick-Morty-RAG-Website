 Eyehole Man is a spandex-clad alien with a megaphone who lives to beat up anyone who is caught with the cereal Eyeholes. He is featured in various commercials across the galaxy, as shown in the episode Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate. He claims that only he can have Eyeholes. Rick Sanchez tells Morty Smith not to be caught with a box of Eyeholes in his possession when the Eyehole Man is around or else he'll start beating him up to get his box of Eyeholes back, but that it is worth the risk. Jerry Smith is later attacked by the Eyehole Man in the post-credits scene as he attempts to steal Rick's box of Eyeholes from his cupboard. As Summer Smith and Morty try to get the Eyehole Man off of Jerry, Rick scolds Jerry for going through his cupboard while Morty asks why he even has a box of Eyeholes. The Eyehole Man is voiced by Justin Roiland. Quotes: Get up on out of here with my Eyeholes! Trivia: In the Rickstaverse mini game Jerrygotchi: Grocery Edition, Jerry eats a free sample of Eyeholes, and as a result gets beaten up by the Eyehole Man.
