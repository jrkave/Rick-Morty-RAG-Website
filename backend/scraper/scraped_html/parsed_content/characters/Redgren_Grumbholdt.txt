Redgren Grumbholdt is a supposedly non-existent character referred to by Rick Sanchez in "A Rickle in Time", the Season 2 opening episode. Rick had thrown a massive party while Jerry and Beth were gone at the end of Season 1 resulting in the the utter destruction of the Smith home. In order to save their asses, Rick freezes time right as Jerry and Beth are walking up to the home.After 6 months of frozen time, Rick, Morty, and Summer had finished fixing the home and were ready to re-start time. Morty - after vacuuming off his parents - replaced Jerry's shirt backwards right before Rick started time back up.After the initial "welcome home", Beth asks Jerry if his shirt is on backwards. Jerry then claims to know he's wearing his shirt backwards, "Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid!". As Jerry walks out of earshot, Rick equates him to someone named 'Redgren Grumbholdt', saying, "Man, that guy is the Redgren Grumbholdt to pretending he knows what's going on." Morty and Summer immediately laugh at the reference after which Rick reveals that he made Redgren Grumbholdt up entirely, and castigates them for laughing at a joke they never could have understood. There is, however, further speculation that Redgren Grumbholdt is in reference to somebody Rick actually knows or knows of, though we've not met him yet in the series. Rick, first saying it to himself as vocalized self-talk, hears Morty and Summer laughing - immediately knowing that they have no idea who Redgren Grumbholdt really is - mocks them for pretending to know and drives the undeniable point home by claiming Redgren Grumbholdt was made up on the spot.
