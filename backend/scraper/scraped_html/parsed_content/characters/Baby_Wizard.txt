Baby Wizard is a minor character that appears in the episode Total Rickall. Like many of the other characters within the episode, he is a disguised Memory Parasite. History: Baby Wizard is a baby who is dressed in star diapers and a wizard's hat. Rick is taken into the garage by Morty Smith, Baby Wizard, and the Duck with Muscles (who Baby Wizard hooked up with him a woman that would become his wife) under the orders of Reverse Giraffe. Morty kills Baby Wizard after he realizes that the parasites can only create pleasant memories. This allows the rest of the Smith family to destroy the parasites that have gone rampant throughout their home.
