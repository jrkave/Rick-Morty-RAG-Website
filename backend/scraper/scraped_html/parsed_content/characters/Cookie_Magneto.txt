 Cookie Magneto is one of the few wacky villains who wanted to fight Rick and get a rise out of him in the Season 6 episode, "Analyze Piss".  Biography:: In "Analyze Piss", he appears after Rick "defeats" Mr. Nimbus and wants to fight Rick, but he refuses and leaves for a minute. Morty was asking what his powers even meant when Rick finally returns and melts his body with a gun, as he didn't want to fight any more "90-styled goofball super-villians". Trivia: He is based on the Marvel Comics supervillian, Magneto.
