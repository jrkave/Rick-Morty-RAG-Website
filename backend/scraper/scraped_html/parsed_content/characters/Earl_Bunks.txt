 Earl Bunks was a citizen of 41-Kepler B. History: He married Edna Bunks and the two had a child, who was named Fred Bunks. After becoming an adult, Fred moved to a distant place in order to enroll in college. Unfortunately, he failed because of his low grades, and since then his life had gotten worse. Fred decided to live with his parents again, and they welcomed him. Earl and Edna later died, presumably of natural causes, leaving their entire inheritance to Fred.
