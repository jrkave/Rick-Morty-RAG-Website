  The Self-Referential Six are a team of antagonists in Meta Reality shown in the Season 6 episode, "Full Meta Jackrick". Each member of this group references a type of literary device or concept, with most of their names being a pun. Their powers are based off of what literary device they represent. Rick Sanchez also reveals that the sixth member of the Self-Referential Six is always "you," indicating whoever is asking. Connie TinuityError, who warps nearby reality in a way that makes it inconsistent with the past. Flash Back, who may enter and observe flashbacks into the past of his targets. Miss Lead, who establishes expectations and subverts them. Mr. Twist, the leader of the team, who creates plot twists, uses smash-cut grenades, and reveals 'you' as the sixth member of the team. Protago Nick, who makes whomever he hits with his beam the protagonist of the story, principally Marvin the Cowardly Security Guard. You. (though contradicted by Rick who states there is no sixth member.)
