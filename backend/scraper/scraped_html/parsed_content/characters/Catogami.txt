 Catogami was a cat robot that briefly served as Morty Smith's personal servant. It fought back against the Time Police when they came to arrest Rick and Morty. Biography:: Catogami was delivered to the Smith's house in a large wooden crate, bursting out and scaring Jerry into fetal position. It immediately walked upstairs to Morty's office where it not long after was order to escort Rick out of. Before it could do this, the Time Police arrived to arrest both Rick and Morty; on the tip Professor Tock managed to get out of Jerry. As Rick and Morty was attempting to escape, Rick activated Catogami's Battle Mode by voice control, to fend off the Time Police. This failed, however, as they were arrested after a 12 hour standoff with the police.
