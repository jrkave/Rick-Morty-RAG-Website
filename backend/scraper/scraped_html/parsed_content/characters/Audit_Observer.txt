 Audit Observer is a character featured in "Rickfending Your Mort". Because of his omniscient ability, Rick hired him to check if Morty’s noted adventures are legitimate. History: Rick was depressed and unwilling to do any adventures, so Morty tried to force an adventure by using the punch card system. Rick refused to believe the adventures he noted are real, so he called in an Observer to serve as an audit to see which “adventures” are real, lame or made up. The Observer was useful for finding fake and real adventures, but at some point he started trying to show unwarranted clips, so they told him to go away, which made him angry. Shortly after leaving the garage, he continued to play clips in front of the house. Eventually the whole Smith Family was gathered watching him, so he started playing embarrassing moments of each member. Annoyed, Morty left the house and pushed the Observer into the road, causing him to be hit and destroyed by a truck, much to Morty’s surprise as he thought Observers were immortal. Rick and Morty were worried and decided to act like nothing happened. Unfortunately for them, other Observers witnessed this incident and brought the duo to a trial to be judged for killing the Audit Observer.
