Photography Raptor was a false character portrayed by the Memory Parasites as seen in "Total Rickall." History: Photography Raptor is an alien parasite who takes the appearance of a utahraptor. In the false memories of the Smith family, he lives with them and constantly takes pictures of things. He first appears in the episode during the fake flashback of Mr. Beauregard accompanying Morty to a school dance.  When Morty found out the parasites can only create pleasant memories, he and the rest of the family determine who were real and began to kill all the parasites. Photography Raptor then tried to escape with the other parasites and was probably killed offscreen.
