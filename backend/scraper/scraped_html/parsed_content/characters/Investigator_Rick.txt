 Investigator Rick was a Rick in the Citadel of Ricks. His only appearance was in The Ricklantis Mixup. Biography:: In The Ricklantis Mixup, Investigator Rick gave Campaign Manager Morty information about Evil Morty in a bar. The information later led to a failed assassination attempt by Campaign Manager Morty on Evil Morty's life. Sometime after sharing the secrets with Campaign Manager Morty, Investigator Rick was killed on Evil Morty's orders, his lifeless corpse later visible floating in space with other Ricks and Mortys ejected from the Citadel.  Trivia: It is possible, but unlikely, that Evil Morty was controlling Investigator Rick, as he did with Evil Rick. This may have been because Evil Morty knew that if his former campaign manager learned the truth, he would try to assassinate him in front of a large crowd of supporters, which would earn him votes of sympathy.Investigator Rick's Morty was never seen, supporting this theory.
