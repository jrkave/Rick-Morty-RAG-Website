 Tom is one of the many Observers featured in "Rickfending Your Mort". History: Tom was in the trial room where Rick and Morty were being judged for killing the Audit Observer. Rick claims that, while he’s not innocent, the Observers are not any better, and uses the courtroom device to play clips of them refusing to help a drowning alien, selling pirated movies and paying homeless aliens to fight. The Judge claims that only some of them are bad, and one of them brings up that the Judge slept with Tom’s wife, Nancy. The Judge proudly asserts that he doesn’t regret it, saying Tom could never see how much of a treasure Nancy was. Tom angrily attacks the Judge and kills him, prompting a massive fight between all Observers. Rick and Morty use this opportunity to escape.
