The President of the Miniverse is the unnamed president who is the head of the society in Zeep Zanflorp's Miniverse. He appeared in the episode The Ricks Must Be Crazy. Like The President of the Microverse and the scientist Zeep, he is the only one who knows about a top secret project being worked on by the scientist Kyle, wherein he is making his own miniature universe that will provide a universal source of energy for them, making the "Flooblecrank" that powers Zeep's universe obsolete. He died, along with everyone else inside the Miniverse, as it was destroyed by Rick Sanchez.
