Summer was the only one who can see her and no one else believes that she's real. However, she appears to the Smiths after a fake memory along with her friends. Her appearance confirms to the family that Summer was real. When the Smiths figure out the parasite's weaknesses, Tinkles attempted to convince Summer not to shoot her by stating she's always loved her. However, Summer simply replies "yep" and shoots her, turning her back into her true form in front of several of her friends, much to their shock, before proceeding to shoot them too. She appeared in the episode Total Rickall. Appearance: Tinkles is a little white lamb with a rainbow unicorn horn. Her ears, hooves, tail. mouth, and hair on top of her head are light pink and her eyes are big and blue. She wears a lavender tutu and a tiara with a red gem in it and also some rainbow knee socks. She also sheds a bunch of white sparkles wherever she is and when she moves quickly enough, she also leaves a trail of rainbows behind. She speaks in an extremely high-pitched voice which is very bubbly and cute. Personality: Tinkles is a happy and blissful creature who is always very happy about everything. She is wide-eyed and cheery, and she is always up for having tons of fun. Even in the most drastic situations, such as Summer trying to kill her, she stays as positive as she can be about it, and she always tries to be happy and wonderful about it.  Trivia: It is unknown why the Smith family did not suspect her as a Parasite, due to her appearing after the flashback. According to Frankenstein's Monster, she was Summer's best friend.
