 The Nippalians is a species of blue-skinned humanoid aliens inhabiting an unnamed planet, which was taken over by the hivemind Unity. The species is split by two different standards of nipple appearance, causing a civil war. Trivia: According to The Art of Rick and Morty, most of these aliens were already background characters in the show, only changed by giving them blue skin and three bulbs.
