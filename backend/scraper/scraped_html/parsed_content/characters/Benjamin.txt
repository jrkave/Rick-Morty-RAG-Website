Benjamin is one of the main protagonists of Ball Fondlers, and a recurring character in Rick and Morty. He films the group's adventures. Appearance: Benjamin wears an orange shirt and headphones. He rarely moves and has a disturbing derpy face, due to him being astonished by the feats of the other Ball Fondlers. His incredibly short arms may be a reference to the original concept of Ball Fondlers, in which the group resembled the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and existed in a world where people's arms were too short to fondle their own junk, hence their name. Appearances: "Rixty Minutes" "Mortynight Run" "The Ricks Must Be Crazy" Rick and Morty Issue 6
