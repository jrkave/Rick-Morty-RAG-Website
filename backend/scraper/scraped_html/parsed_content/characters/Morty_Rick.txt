Morty Rick is either a Rick, a Morty, or a combination of both. He appeared in the episode The Rickshank Rickdemption, in the background at the Citadel of Ricks. In the same episode, many Mortys are killed when the Citadel of Ricks is transported into a prison of the Galactic Federation, it is unknown if Morty Rick is one of the Mortys who died. Appearance: Morty Rick wears Morty's clothes with Rick's labcoat. He shares his head shape and facial structure with Morty, while his hairstyle and physique, along with his hair and skin colors, are shared with Rick. Trivia: The RickShank Rickdemption (Game) identifies him as "Scientist Morty". Morty Rick's existence has led to a minor fan theory that all Mortys are younger Ricks, with Morty Rick being a missing link between the two species. This theory is supported by Tiny Rick's hair color and Morty-like body proportions, the absence of any explicitly adult Mortys in the show, and the lack of a designated partner for Morty Rick.
