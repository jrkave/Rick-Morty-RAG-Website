  Shrimply Pibbles is the galaxy's most influential civil rights leader. He appears in Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate when Jerry's penis is needed to replace his failing heart. After Jerry eventually refuses to donate his penis, Shrimply's supporters manage to amass enough money to perform the operation with a synthetic heart instead of Jerry's penis and save him anyway.Â  Trivia: Pibbles famously marched on Flurtblurt Square. His home planet, which had an atmosphere that was 10% heroin, was destroyed by Klargon death squads. As a result, he needs to constantly be breathing heroin in order to survive outside his home planet, making him "heroin dependent". Pibbles is often mistaken for the Old Reptile. His outfit and mannerisms are reminiscent of real-world civil rights leader Mahatma Gandhi.
