 Dr. Glip-Glop is a minor character introduced in the episode "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate". He was initially assigned to treat Jerry, who was suffering from an illness after consuming mutant bacteria. However, as Dr. Glip-Glop was introducing himself, Jerry vomited on him. The goo landed on his eyes and sent him into a murderous rage due to its effects. Before he could attack anyone, he was shot and disintegrated by Rick. He was labelled by the hospital staff to be the "Best Doctor in the Galaxy." Trivia: Dr. Glip-Glop shares his name with the derogatory term for Traflorkians, a term first described in "Ricksy Business" . The term is described by Rick as "the N-word and the C-word had a baby, and that baby was raised by all the bad words for jews."
