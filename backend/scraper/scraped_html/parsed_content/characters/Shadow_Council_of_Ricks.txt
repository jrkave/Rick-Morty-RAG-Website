 The Shadow Council of Ricks, also known as the Brotherhood Counsel was a secret cabal forming the true (shadow) government ruling over the Citadel. The Shadow Council predated the normal Council of Ricks and consisted of the most powerful Ricks in the Citadel. All but two of its nine members were summarily ordered to be executed by Evil Morty shortly after his election triumph, their corpses ejected into space to join other Ricks and Mortys who were deceased. Membership: The Ricks on the Shadow Council apparently represented major business concerns of the Citadel. Each Rick owned and operated large corporations. Some Ricks were reminiscent of either real-world industry captains (such as the two surviving members, who look like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs) or global upper-class stereotypes. Rick D.
