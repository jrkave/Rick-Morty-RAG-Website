 Poncho was a character in Rick and Morty. He appears as a bodyguard and the main antagonist in the episode "Anatomy Park." Poncho was a hired gun for Dr. Xenon Bloom to provide security for Anatomy Park. He originally approaches Morty with disdain, but later compliments the boy's ability to think on his feet. It is later revealed that Poncho was responsible for the outbreak of diseases, when Morty discovers Poncho carrying around the Bubonic Plague. Poncho reveals that he'd perform any job over working for Dr. Xenon Bloom, who gave him horrible employee benefits. When the safety of Annie is threatened, Morty throws himself at Poncho. The Bubonic plague then turns on Poncho, who falls from a high balcony. Trivia: The tattoo on Poncho's right shoulder is an ode to the South African band Die Antwoord. He could be a nod to Jurassic Park character Dennis, they both were workers to the park who betrayed the CEO for monetary gain and subsequently died to the dinosaurs/diseases.  Site Navigation:
