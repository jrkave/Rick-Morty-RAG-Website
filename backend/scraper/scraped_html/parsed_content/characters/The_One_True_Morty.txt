  The One True Morty is a holy prophet, believed to be true by a group of Mortys worship him as a god. He is recognized as the god of Mortyism. He was mentioned in the episode Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind. Biography:: The One True Morty is a Morty who is seen as the god of Mortyism. He is taught about in a book called The Good Morty, and is portrayed as a god who will lead Mortys to stop following their Ricks and being independent, choosing the path of The One True Morty, leading them to a rewarding eternity in The Morty Afterlife Zone. In Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind, a group of Mortys were being held in Evil Rick's torture chamber and had formed a cult, where they had read The Good Morty and believed that someday, The One True Morty will come and set them free of the torture chamber and relieve them of their sufferings. Thus creating a religious formation. When Morty Smith from the Prime Dimension arrived, they believed him to be The One True Morty. Despite the fact that Morty looked nothing like the one depicted in the book, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's not The One True Morty. He followed through with exactly what the book said by freeing all the locked-up Mortys and overthrowing Evil Rick. A drawback, however to this, is in Pocket Mortys, where the dimension he originates is not from the Cronenberged Dimension. Pocket Mortys: In Pocket Mortys, The One True Morty starts out as an egg and hatches at level 20. Pocket Mortys also informs of The One True Morty's dimension: Dimension C-568.
