Jessica W. of the Parmesan dimension is a student at Harry Herpson High School. She is a popular girl in Morty Smith's math class who he has a crush on. Jessica has shown interest in Morty at several points, although the two are never able to fully commit to anything due to Morty's sci-fi adventures getting in the way. In the Parmesan dimension, she was shown to be on an apparent romantic date with Morty in a brief flashback in "Rickfending Your Mort", implying that the events of "Mort Dinner Rick Andre" never happened in this dimension.  Appearance: Jessica is a teenage girl with shoulder-length ginger/orange hair, a pale complexion, and a pear-shaped body. She has long eyelashes and prominent light-peach lips. She is about a head taller than Morty. Day to day, she wears a pale cyan hairband, a form-fitting, periwinkle polo slightly unbuttoned, a box-pleated mauve miniskirt, pale cyan mid-calf socks, and plain white loafers. In "Rickfending Your Mort", she is shown wearing a lavender headband, a halter-strapped, lavender dress with a sweetheart neckline and a knee-length Basque skirt (either unlined or filled out thinly with tulle layers) cinched at the waist by a bisected, paler lavender belt, and white, pointed-toe high heels.
