Wow. There literally IS everything in space. History: The Space Snake is the snake that starts the Snake War in "Rattlestar Ricklactica". Morty and Rick were arguing about piss and centipedes (for some reason) and the car "gets a flat". RIck leaves the ship and warns Morty to NOT LEAVE THE SHIP. Morty ends up leaving the ship and a space snake bites him, starting the whole episodes plot. Fortnite Item: Space Snake is a Rare Harvesting Tool in Fortnite: Battle Royale, that can be purchased in the Item Shop for 800 V-Bucks or with the Mecha Morty Bundle for 2,200 V-Bucks. It was first released in Chapter 2: Season 7 and is part of the Morty, C-137 Set.
