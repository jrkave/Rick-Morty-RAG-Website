 Noob-Noob is a small masked character who made his first appearance in Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender. He is the underappreciated intern of the Vindicators, and most of his tasks are janitor work.  Noob-Noob appears to be ready to graduate to a full Vindicator, but is forced to remain behind after Rick gets drunk, passes out, and defecates all over the ship's holo-table. Nevertheless, he seems to be the only member of the Vindicators that enjoys Rick's humor, and as Rick later reveals to Morty (while drunk), Noob-Noob is the only one that Rick values, even more than Morty, to which Morty replies with "Motherf***er." At the end of the episode, Logic raps about how underappreciated Noob-Noob is, although Rick doesn't remember him.  Appearances: "Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender" "Rick and Morty Theme Song" (non-speaking cameo) "Rick Can Handle It" "Pro-Nouns" (non-speaking cameo) "First Love" "Girls Night" "Heroes" "Rick and Morty Issue 44" "Rick and Morty Presents: The Vindicators" Trivia: Noob-Noob is believed to be from the same species of Mr. Poopybutthole, Stealy, and Benjamin. Noob-Noob can be viewed as a parody of cartoon superhero sidekicks such Snarf from the Thundercats or Orko from the He-Man series, whose only apparent purpose is to provide comic relief. Merchandise:
