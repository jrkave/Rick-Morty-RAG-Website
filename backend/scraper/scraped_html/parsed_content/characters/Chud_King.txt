 CHUD King is the King of the CHUD people and father of Po√±eta. History: The King of the Chuds is the the ruler of a race of cannibalistic, subterranean horse people. The President of the United States reveals that he and his people have been war with humanity for centuries.  Upon capturing Rick, Morty and Sticky the King sentences them to be eaten for the crime of sleeping with his daughter, Princess Ponietta, an act that Rick recalls having committed upon being reminded.  Before the execution can be carried out however, Ponietta intercedes on the grounds that she loves Rick and is pregnant with his child.  The King is surprised and pleased to learn that he will have an heir to his throne and releases Rick, Morty and Sticky. The King then sends the Chud army to assist the United States in its battle against Morty's gigantic sperm: ending the centuries long war between the Chud and humanity.
