 Adjudicator Rick was the adjudicator at the first presidential debate at The Citadel. Appearance: Adjudicator Rick had combed grey-blue hair and unibrow. He was tall and lanky, like most Ricks, with bags under his eyes. He wore a navy blue suit with a red and maroon striped tie, and a light blue shirt. Biography:: Adjudicator Rick along with other Ricks in the crowd were judging the candidates for the next President of The Citadel. It was shown that he didn't take President Morty very seriously and neither did the other candidates. He mocked Candidate Morty while asking his question, to the entertainment of both the Rick audience and the Rick candidates. His reaction after Candidate Morty's answer is not known, but presumed to be equal to that of the other candidates, who did not join the audience in cheering.  His disrespect towards Candidate Morty would soon come back to bite him when Candidate Morty became President Morty. After seizing control of The Citadel, the new president ordered the arrest and assassination of a number of Ricks and Mortys he felt wronged by. Adjudicator Rick was one of them, and he was soon arrested and/or killed by the Guard Ricks. His lifeless body was later dumped into space along with a great amount of other dead Ricks and Mortys.  Trivia: Adjudicator Rick is based on Anderson Cooper, who co-moderated the second 2016 presidential debate. Site Navigation:
