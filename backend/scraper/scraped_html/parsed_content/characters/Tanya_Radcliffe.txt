 Tanya Radcliffe was a citizen of 41-Kepler B. History: Tanya was an elderly woman who had been suffering in a hospital bed for years. She lost all of her loved ones and wanted to die, but she couldn’t do anything as euthanasia wasn’t legal yet. During the events of “That's Amorte”, Madame President found out that when Spaghetti People commit suicide, their organs turn into spaghetti, a type of food that is delicious to other species. She then had doctors tell Tanya that she could end her life if she consented to having her spaghetti eaten by an alien, which she agreed to. Tanya died off-screen through assisted suicide, and the President offered her spaghetti to Morty so he could taste test it. Morty admitted it was easier to digest knowing the victim permitted it.
