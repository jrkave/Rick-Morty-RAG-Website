Lady Katana was a former member of The Vindicators, who was said to have died in their second adventure, a fight against Doom-Nomitron, along with Calypso and Diablo Verde. In Vindicators 2: Girls Night, it is revealed that she never fought Doom-Nomitron, and was actually killed by Supernova when she blacked out drunk. Appearance: She was never seen, but was mentioned in "Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender". She appears as a stereotypical Western racial caricature of an Asian person with a long ponytail, wearing a purple ninja outfit and wielding a katana. She also appears to have robotic limbs, suggesting she is either an android, a cyborg or has limb prostheses. Personality: She, Calypso, and Diablo Verde were all vocally aware that they're only on the team for good optics, and refuse to be used as cannon fodder by the others. Powers and Abilities: When Supernova suggests that Lady Katana can get inside Doom-Nomitron and sever its primary nerve cluster with her katanas, but Lady Katana shoots that idea down because the cluster is made of titanium and her katanas would break against it. Her cybernetics may make her an extremely deadly combatant with katanas, but the weapons themselves are mundane. Appearances: "Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender" (mentioned) "Rick Can Handle It" "Pro-Nouns" (non-speaking cameo) "The Dance" "Out of Gas" (non-speaking cameo) "Mercy Kill" (non-speaking cameo) "Girls Night" "Little Trains" (mentioned) "Heroes" (pictured) Trivia: She is a parody of Katana from Suicide Squad.
