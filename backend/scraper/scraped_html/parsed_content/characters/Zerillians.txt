Zerillians are large, 3-eyed, humanoid beings with warty skin.  Appearance: Zerillians vary on height and skin color; a prisoner was tall and pink, while an office worker was short and brown. They all have large warts all over their body, three eyes and unibrow.  History: Rick was assigned a space in galactic prison next to a Zerillian who asked him what he was in for, Rick then responded with "everything". This Zerillian later broke out after The Citadel was transported into the prison. Another Zerillian worked in the same office as Jerry Smith before the Blemflarck Crisis hit. He was killed in front of Jerry during the ensuing riot. Trivia: The Zerillian in "The Wedding Squanchers" was voiced by Tom Kenny.
