First seen in Pilot, the alien is seen briefly for a few seconds when Rick and Morty are trying to escape the customs staff (Gromflomites). When Morty coughs after another alien, who is smoked what appears to Cannabis (or something of the same likeness), the creature is born. However after a few seconds, it has already aged and died.
