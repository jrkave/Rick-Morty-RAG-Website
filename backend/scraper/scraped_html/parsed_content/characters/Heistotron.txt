It is an artificial intelligence entity, designed and built by Rick Sanchez to perform sophisticated heists.â€‹ Biography:: Heistotron was designed by Rick Sanchez with the initial purpose of challenging Miles Knightly, a renowned heist artist known in the galaxy, to a "heist-off". However, the machine developed its own consciousness due to the sophisticated heist algorithm embedded in it by Rick, and it started to "heist" the universe, causing chaos and mayhem. It started recruiting individuals for its crew and then erasing their memories to perform unpredictable heists. Eventually, its ambition escalated to the point where it planned to heist the entire universe. Rick, Morty, and a crew of characters they assemble manage to outsmart Heistotron by exploiting its algorithm, which is designed to counter every plan with a more convoluted one.
