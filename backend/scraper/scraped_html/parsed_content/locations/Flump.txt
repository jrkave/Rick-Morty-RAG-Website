Flump was a planet shaped like a pink butt, located inside of a pink/purple nebula. It got stolen by Heistotron after it went rogue on Rick Sanchez. History: Flump was heisted by the robot Heistotron and kept inside of a chamber in the robot's giant space station, next to Timbus. Rick managed to cause both Heistotron and Randotron to malfunction, resulting in the space station blowing up and destroying all the planets inside. Trivia: Flump might be Buttworld. Only the upper part of the planet's name tag was shown in the episode, making it possible that the planet has a second part to its name.
