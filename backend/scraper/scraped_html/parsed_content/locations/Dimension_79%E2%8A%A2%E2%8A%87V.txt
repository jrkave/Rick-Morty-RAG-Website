Dimension 79⊢⊇V (Seven-Nine-Turnstile-Superset-Vee) is a dimension in the multiverse and the dimension where Evil Morty and Evil Rick come from. History: This dimension is similar to most, with a Morty who was a regular teenager who went on adventures with his Rick. This was until he was fed up with how their adventures left him and Rick's treatment of him. After getting Rick drunk, Morty subdued him and turned him into his puppet, controlling him through his eye patch. Afterwards, Evil Morty and Rick left Dimension 79⊢⊇V to wipe them from The Citadel's database and murder alternate Ricks so Morty could learn all the knowledge they had gathered for his own benefits. It's unknown what happened to this dimension's Jerry, Beth and Summer, though it could be presumed they're still alive. Unlike the rest of the dimensions shown in the series, the Smith residence lacks a huge crack in the driveway, as the events of "Ricksy Business" likely never happened in this reality.
