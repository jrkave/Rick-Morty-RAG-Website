Known inhabitants: Morty Smith (304-X) Summer Smith (304-X) Jerry Smith (304-X) Beth Smith (304-X) Trivia: Since Rick's Father never married and not had any children (possibly): Rick, Beth, Summer and Morty does not exist in this universe.That creates a plot hole: since Ricks were only able to access realities in the Central Finite Curve, a portion of the multiverse where Rick is the smartest being in his dimension, it's unknown how they managed to travel in this dimension since Rick doesn't even exist here.
