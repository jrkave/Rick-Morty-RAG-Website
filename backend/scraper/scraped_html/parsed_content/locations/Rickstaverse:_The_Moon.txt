 You're on the moon. It's just a big gray rock, don't get excited.Explore the mysteries that this pile of moon dust has to offer.   Warps: none currently available Collectibles: none currently available   TheMoon 01-So I know you're used to all my crazy intergalactic adventures and whatnot but truth is there's not a whole lot going on on the moon. Sorry to force that red pill down your throat. TheMoon 02-Yep, still nothing. TheMoon 03-Go ahead, keep clicking, you're not gonna find anything. TheMoon 04-Look, this is kinda my secret spot. Let's keep this between you and me, I don't need a bunch of rich Europeans and trustafarians Brooklyn-ing up the place. TheMoon 05-Again, nothing. Y-y-you gotta keep looking. TheMoon 06-Seriously how bored ARE you? What, did you burn through all of LinkedIn? Because honestly that'd be more exciting than this ball of dust. TheMoon 07-The only thing that'd make this square lamer is a filter. TheMoon 08-Spoiler alert, the flag's plastic. TheMoon 09-This buggy is like the Playskool of astroscience. TheMoon 10-You should thank whatever thing you pray to that you can't see what's causing Ruben to cast this shadow. #RigorMortis TheMoon 11-WHOA! Check it out! Some craters! GET PUMPED bro! TheMoon 12-Are those, uh, D&D dice? What kind of loser plays Dungeons & Dragons on the moon? TheMoon 13-I'll admit, that looks ominous. But I'd rather be stranded on this gray rock with whatever did that than have Jerry explain the hidden meanings behind Avatar again. TheMoon 14-Tag all your friends that love craters! Then think about getting b-b-better friends. TheMoon 15-Congrats, you made it to the last square. Just click the back button already and go to someplace more interesting!
