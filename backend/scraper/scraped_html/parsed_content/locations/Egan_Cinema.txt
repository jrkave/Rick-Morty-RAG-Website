Egan Cinema is the theater located in same dimension as the TV series, Ball Fondlers, and Giant Telepathic Spiders.  In "The Ricks Must Be Crazy", Rick, Morty, and Summer can be seen leaving the theater after watching a full motion picture adaption of the Ball Fondlers TV series. Summer spends the majority of the episode parked outside of the Egan Cinema facing traumatic situations with Rick's Car. Posters outside include a poster for a sequel for Two Brothers called Three Brothers, a movie titled French Toast starring Piece of Toast, a movie named Flaps (possibly referencing Terryfold), a poster that looks like a murderous Full House, a movie named Squirts and what looks like a poster for Ice-T/Water T's movie Water-T and the Rise of the Numbericons.
