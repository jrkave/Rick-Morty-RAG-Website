The Moon is the Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It orbits around Earth with synchronous rotation, always showing the same face. It still holds the remains from the Apollo 11-mission. There is presumably a dangerous creature, the evidence being a disemboweled astronaut and large reptilian footprints. A particular detail about the moon - in both the show and real life - is that the moon has never been given an actual name, despite moons of other planets having one. Despite this, some have given the moon the name "Luna". History: It makes a notable appearance in the episode Morty's Mind Blowers, when Morty is watching it through a telescope and believes he sees "a regular dude" walk on it. This man is later introduced at Harry Herpson High School as the new guidance councilor. After a misunderstanding with Principal Vagina, resulting in the man taking his own life, Morty revisits his telescope to find a smudge on the lense. Believing it all to have been a mistake, Morty asks Rick to remove his memory of the event. Trivia: Earth's moon appears in Rickstaverse containing a dead astronaut, D&D dice and Rick on a beach chair with a parasol and beer. Site Navigation:
