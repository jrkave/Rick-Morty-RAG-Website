Birding Manapalooza Flargabarg is the name of an alien music festival where Rick Sanchez first met Birdperson and Squanchy. History: Not much is definitively known about the venue or where it is held, except that the festival grounds are shown to feature a stage playing EDM and appears to welcome most species of alien attendees to co-mingle in the crowd. Some speculate that it may have been hosted on Birdperson's homeworld, owing to its bird-themed symbolism and décor. Trivia: The festival nomenclature was shown to be inconsistent in the episode's closed captioning on the official Adult Swim YouTube clip released shortly after the premiere. While escaping, Rick explains to Birdperson and Memory Tammy that "The exit's when we met at Burning Man and did Senthol Diempathate." This is a confirmed misnomer evident by the inclusion of Birding Man Morty to Pocket Mortys contradicting Rick's pronunciation. This ultimately suggests the festival was veritably called Birding Manapalooza Flargabarg, but that Rick insists on referring to it as "Burning Man" instead.The naming convention of this social gathering references some notable real world examples of outdoor music festivals like Burning Man and Lollapalooza with the "flargabarg" suffix to infer it is taking place on an alien planet.

Birdperson's memory of the event affirms that The Flesh Curtains played their first live show here. It is implied that the formation of their band was a direct result of their collectively impaired judgement while under the influence of hallucinogens.  ↑
