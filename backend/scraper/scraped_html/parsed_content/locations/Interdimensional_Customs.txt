Intergalactic Customs is a location shown in the episode "Pilot". Function: It is an area controlled by the Galactic Federation to limit intergalactic travel, find fugitives and seize contraband. Acting like an airport, Customs Stations are set up on Federation controlled worlds and a fixed portal is built to allow registered travel to other worlds via a blue portal. History: Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith passed through customs on their way from Dimension 35-C to the Prime Dimension while smuggling Mega Seeds. Morty hid the seeds up his butt in order to pass through the scanners undetected, but Morty was randomly picked to go through a new machine which can detect stuff up someone's butt. The duo pushed away the guard and ran through the scanners. Security was quick to pursue them, but could not stop them before they reached a portal. While Rick typed in their coordinates, Morty covered him by shooting at the guards. He mortally wounded the guard Glenn before he and Rick escaped back to Earth.   Trivia: It is likely the location and the agency collapsed alongside the Galactic Federation. The existence of interdimensional customs (and an entire Galactic Federation structure devoted to interdimensional travel, with a portal inside it) contradicts The Rickshank Rickdemption, which implies that the Galactic Federation does not have the secret of interdimensional travel and desperately wants to steal it from Rick. No episode after the pilot has suggested that the Galactic Federation has access to any form of interdimensional technology.
