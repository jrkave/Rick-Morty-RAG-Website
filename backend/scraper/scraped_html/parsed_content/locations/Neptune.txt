 Neptune is a planet in Earth's Solar System and the furthest away from the Sun. History: When the Sons of the Moon started attacking the Sun, the representatives of several planets reunited in the Neutral Zone to discuss the conflict. Among them, there was an unnamed character similar to God Neptune, likely serving as a representative for the planet of the same name. Morty tried to join the discussion and revealed he has the Solar Scepter, and that led to a war as everyone tried to get the object so they could rule the Solar System. In the end, the Knights of the Sun used their powers to end the war. Rick brought the Scepter back to the Sun and, after he and Morty faked a sacrifice, peace was restored in the Solar System. Trivia: It’s unknown if the planet has any other inhabitants or if “God Neptune” is the only one. Site Navigation:
