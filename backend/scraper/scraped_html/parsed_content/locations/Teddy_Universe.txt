The Teddy Universe is a German-speaking dystopian fascist universe inhabited by sentient teddy bear-versions of their human counterparts in the Dimension C-131 and home to Teddy Rick. History: Rick Sanchez woke up in the body of this universe's Rick's clone, after dying in two prior fascist universes. He was immediately greeted by his teddy counterpart, who in German asked him if he was a fascist. Rick then noticed how the underground lair was decorated with fascist imagery and outfits. This realization prompted Rick to kill himself by smashing his head into the glass chamber and impaling himself on the large shards of glass. Information: This universe is ruled by a fascist regime called "BR", whom Teddy Rick has fought under in the past. He kept several of their banners in his underground lair, along with military outfits, guns, photographs, and a medal.
