  Lil' Bits is a restaurant shown in a commercial in "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate". The main theme of Lil' Bits is that everything on the menu is extremely tiny-sized, intended for people with tiny mouths. Everyone shown in the commercial has large spherical heads with small facial features. In a deleted scene, Rick says that he has eaten there and thinks the whole thing is a front so that the owner can harass people in the bathroom.
