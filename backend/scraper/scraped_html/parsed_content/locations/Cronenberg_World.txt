Cronenberg World is Earth in a dimension where humans were naturally occurring Cronenbergs. History: The Rick and Morty of this dimension leave after they accidentally turn the entire world into regular humans. They subsequently take a portal to an alternate version of Earth where Rick C-137 had recently turned almost the entire human population into Cronenbergs in the episode "Rick Potion No. 9". Appearances: "Rick Potion #9" (mentioned) Notable Inhabitants: Cronenberg Rick (formerly) Cronenberg Morty (formerly) Cronenbergs who turned into ordinary normal people. Quotes: Trivia: The word "Cronenberg" is a reference to the Canadian filmmaker David Paul Cronenberg. According to Wikipedia, Cronenberg "...is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the body horror or venereal horror genre. This style of filmmaking explores people's fears of bodily transformation and infection." It's revealed in "Rick and Morty Issue 45" that the Cronenberg World's Cronenbergs are fully capable of speech and critical thought. This differentiates Cronenberg Rick and Cronenberg Morty from the mindless Cronenbergs of the infected Earth, as they can fully think and talk like "normal" people. Even though this dimension is still called "Cronenberg World", it is no longer inhabited by any Cronenbergs.
