 Saturn is a planet located in Earth’s Solar System. Its inhabitants, the Saturnians, participated in a Solar War against several other planets. Description: Saturn is a gas giant that is apparently sustainable enough to be home to several Saturnians. It has a ring system and several moons, notable ones being Titan and Phoebe. History: The planet is mentioned in Morty’s Mind Blowers. One of Morty’s traumatic memories happens on Saturn’s moon, Titan. There, the Warlord of Titan kidnapped Beth and her children, and then forced her to choose which one should live. After she quickly chose Summer, Rick appeared from a portal and killed the alien. Rick explained that he accidentally went to Phoebe instead of Titan, complaining Saturn should have its moons numbered instead of named, and then freed his daughter and grandchildren. In A Rick in King Mortur's Mort, the representatives of several planets, including Saturn, reunited in the Neutral Zone, to discuss the recent attack on the Sun, which was caused by the Sons of the Moon. Morty tried to participate in the discussion, but after revealing he brought the Solar Scepter to the place, a war began as all the representatives tried to get their hands on the object so they could rule the Solar System. After the Knights of the Sun reunited once again, they used their power to end the war. The Saturnians and everybody else embraced the peace. Trivia: The Knights of the Sun used to think all planets revolved around the Solar Scepter, and that if they didn’t keep it on the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn would “bump into each other” Site Navigation:
