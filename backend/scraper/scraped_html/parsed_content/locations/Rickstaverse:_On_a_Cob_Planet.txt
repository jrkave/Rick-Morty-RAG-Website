Collectibles: n33dful th1ng 6  OTC 01-Imagine what one of these things could do while flying over your car. OTC 02-Let's deep fry one of those bad boys and strike it rich on the State Fair circuit. Who's in? OTC 03-I don't wanna stick around for hail on the cob, that's for damn sure. OTC 04-So the leaves grow on a cobb, but the tree isn't a cobb? C'mon God, commit to your bits. OTC 05-Some more tasteful nudity for ya. OTC 06-I bet those mountains are covered with trash on the cobb thanks to bored rich guys leaving their CLIF Bar wrappers everywhere. OTC 07-Could really use a warp to the close-up version of that mountain, I wanna see a marmot-on-a-cob. OTC 08-Does the cob taste like strawberries? Does it turn into feces-on-the-cob inside your body? So many questions, so little desire for answers. OTC 09-Yo @MonsantoCo is this your fault? OTC 10-Looks like that bitch-ass Mr. Needful discovered this place before we did. I don't have my curse-purging equipment, so this one is on you.

I want to build a sentient A.I. with a cold, logical core to develop brutal yet efficient killbots with razor-sharp teeth, just for the purpose of itching my itchy skin. From, y'know, the bugs. OTC 13-What, no bush on the cob? Everything is NOT zen, thank you very much. OTC 14-Here's some boredom-on-a-cob for ya. OTC 15-We are all made of cobs.
