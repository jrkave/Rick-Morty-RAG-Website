 Dimension M592 is mentioned in the backup comic of Rick and Morty Issue 17. According to Rick, some “douchebags” were snagging his items there, so he decided to “borrow” Jerry and force him to be on the lookout in M582. Rick then created “Jerry-bot” to replace Jerry during his absence. After he and Rick returned to Dimension C-131, Rick destroyed Jerry-bot, much to the family’s sadness as they preferred him over the real Jerry.
