 This unnamed planet is the main setting of "Rick and Morty: Lil’ Poopy Superstar". It is the homeworld of the Sausage Fellas, including Mr. Poopybutthole. Description: Mr. Poopybutthole’s planet is mostly identical to Earth, to the point where it has the same movies but with slightly different titles (e.g Poopbutt 2: Electric Boogaloo, Poopbusters and Jurassic Poop). Other than that, it seems to have a more extreme justice system, with Summer being sentenced to death on the same day she was accused of “brainwashing” Mr. Poopybutthole. History: This is the original home of Mr. Poopybutthole. At some point, he became famous, even starring in several movies, but eventually got tired of it and escaped to Earth. However, he felt bad for leaving everyone anxious about his disappearance, so he asked Summer to help him announce that, although he’s gonna move to Earth, he’s not dead. He announced his departure on Neeeews, but the reporter accused Summer of having brainwashed him, so she was sent to Space Jail. Mr. Poopybutthole was also arrested, by his former agent Cecelia, who wanted to force him to star in more movies. Summer and Mr. Poopybutthole later escaped back to Earth after defeating Cecelia. Annoyed because Mr. Poopybutthole took Summer to the prom instead of him, Rick Sanchez went to Mr. Poopybutthole’s Planet and brought Cecelia to the prom.
