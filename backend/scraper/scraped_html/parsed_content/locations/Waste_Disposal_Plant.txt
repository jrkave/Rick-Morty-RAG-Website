 The Waste Disposal Plant is located in the outskirts of the city in The Citadel.  History: Slick Morty, Lizard Morty, Fat Morty and Glasses Morty believed a portal was located in this plant called "The Wishing Portal", which would fulfill any wish made after a sacrifice was given. The four Mortys arrived here and sacrificed items important to them in order to get a wish, but Slick Morty sacrificed himself to be free. The portal was shortly after revealed to used for garbage disposal. Site Navigation:
