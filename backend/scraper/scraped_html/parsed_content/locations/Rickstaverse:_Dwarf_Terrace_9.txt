 Description: Dwarf Terrace-9 (or Tiny Planet) is a dwarf Earth-like planet with a circumference of 330 yards (302m),132'808 times smaller than Earth. It was home to a species of tiny pigs, which were hunted to extinction by the Smiths for breakfast. The Smith family moved there for a short period, having to stay off the Galactic Federation's radar. Morty noted that the main feature distinguishing it from Earth is the lack of Africa(White people problems). Warps: None currently available. Collectibles: Jerrygotchi 6  DT9 01-That's not a movement arc. The frisbee's just ripping a line in the planet's ozone layer. DT9 02-For your information, we didn't wipe out the ENTIRE rainforest for this cozy abode. It was the outhouse that finished it off. DT9 03-Don't dwell too much on this sunset, you'll see another one in like, a hour and a half. DT9 04-This lake is filled with Jerry's makeshift golf balls. DT9 05-Morty playing with himself again. Some things never change. DT9 06-I guess you could consider this part of the world "war-torn" because this is where Morty and Summer fought over the last piece of bacon. DT9 07-Is it still considered a desert when there's water 10 feet away? DT9 08-I'm giving you a chance to name this tiny country. Any suggestions? DT9 09-Add in some JPEG artifacting to this pic and slap on "I WANT TO BELIEVE" in Impact and BOOM, instant conspiracy theory. DT9 10-I think there were some tiny penguins over here. At least, that's what I think I saw on the bottom of my boot. DT9 11-My balls are shrinking just looking at that cold-ass water. DT9 12-New Australia is a lot like old Australia, except our leader's not as big of a tool. DT9 13-Those mountains are so small you can't even sled down 'em. But at least nothing's on a cob. DT9 14-See that flag? That means this square is MINE! Go "first" some other square. DT9 15-If these ice caps melt, we could see as much as a 3 inch rise in sea levels!
