A spacecraft built by the inhabitants of Unity's Planet, prior to them being assimilated by Unity. History: In "Auto Erotic Assimilation", Rick, along with Morty and Summer, responds to a distress beacon from S.S. Independence, hoping to find an empty ship to loot for valuables. He instead finds some remaining unassimilated inhabitants from Unity's Planet, but Unity quickly absorbs them before greeting Rick. The ship transports Rick and company to Unity's planet, and this is the last time we see it. Trivia: The name is an obvious joke, as its crew is currently possessed by Unity.
