Tryonicon-5 is a planet devastated by pollution and destruction. It was the home of the fourth-dimensional thoughtform, Ava, prior to its destruction by Rick Sanchez. History: A powerful AI called Ava was constructed on this planet; programmed for interstellar diplomacy in a desperate attempt to stop intergalactic mutually assured destruction.  Rick Sanchez, Bleph, Mario and Alexandre were sent to this planet by their common former lover, Unity. Their mission was to extract Ava. Alexandre died in a puddle of acid when they reached the planet's surface, Mario was shot to death by soldiers, and Bleph decided to run off with one of the soldiers. Only Rick reached Ava, but elected to destroy the AI when it tried to talk Rick into making better life decisions. Inhabitants: The living inhabitants of Tryonicon-5 are for the most part soldiers dressed in all-covering armor, protecting them from the acids and poisonous elements on the planet. They speak English and are prone to attack aliens on sight.  Nature: The planet is covered with toxic waste and ruined structures overgrown with plants. Pools of acid can easily be found on the surface, the ground is mostly sand and rocks, and the few plants seen are growing onto buildings.
