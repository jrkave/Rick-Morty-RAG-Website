The Holographic Simulation is a giant spacecraft that appeared in the episode "M. Night Shaym-Aliens!", that made a giant holographic projection, portraying the planet Earth, created by the Zigerions to trick Rick into giving them the information for concentrated dark matter. The holographic simulation actually had three layers of holographic projection which were to trick him into letting his guard down. Jerry was also accidentally caught up into this, somehow. It was destroyed in the episode's conclusion, killing all of the Zigerions.
