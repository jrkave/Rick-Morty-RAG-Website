 The Transdimensional Energy Relay, also known as Infinite Energy Relay, was a technological windmill located in Valhalla. It was built by Rick for the purpose of harvesting the afterlife’s infinite energy and sending it to his garage on Earth. Usage: Like Heaven, Valhalla contains a paradimensional layer of infinite energy so it can preserve the consciousness of its inhabitants. The Transdimensional Energy Relay was created to collect this energy and send it to the living world, where Rick would be able to use it to his advantage. The device’s energy was mainly used as a weapon, and as a means to return to the living world. Beings who are killed by the relay’s energy will be immediately sent to Valhalla, even if they didn’t die in Norway. History: Rick wanted the infinite energy of an afterlife, but since he couldn’t access Heaven thanks to his atheistic mind, he instead went to Valhalla and started building it there. He and Morty accidentally started a conflict with the local Vikings and had to protect the windmill from them. After the Transdimensional Energy Relay was finished, Rick convinced the Vikings that he was Odin and commanded them to never go near the windmill. Rick and Morty used the same device to return to Earth, but found out that The Pope had hijacked the energy relay. Because of the infinite energy, the Pope was unbeatable, even with Bigfoot and other monsters assisting the duo in trying to defeat him. Rick eventually realized this and, after coming back to Valhalla, he intentionally angered the Vikings to get them to destroy the energy relay, but not before Rick and Morty returned to Earth. It was destroyed off-screen, evidenced by the fact the Pope no longer had his powers and was easily defeated.  Locations:
