Blue Ball Motels is a chain of motels in the US. Summer Smith and Danny Publitz checked into one after they matched on Lovefinderrz.  History: Summer and Danny matched right after downloading the dating app "Lovefinderrz", and immediately left to check into a motel. Beth Smith came chasing after them and followed them to the motel. When she couldn't convince Summer to not spend the night with Danny, she booked the room next to theirs. That night, Summer matched with Jeff while Danny was asleep and crept out without him knowing, but with Beth still following her.
