The Pawn Shop Planet is a very tiny planet, most likely a dwarf, that appeared in the episode "Raising Gazorpazorp". Its only known inhabitant is an alien who most likely does not live there but only goes there to work, who is known to eat sulfur. Story: Rick brought Morty along to this pawn shop in search of a defraculator, but could only find a broken one. While Rick and the shop owner haggled over the price, a bored Morty was toying with a claw before seeing a sex robot lying around. He asked Rick for a souvenir, a memory from their travels together in case Rick died. Rick finally gave in and bought the broken defraculator, along with the sex robot, for 60 smidgens. Geography: It is a planet with nothing but a Pawn Shop on it. The ground of the entire planet is a parking lot, made out of pavement with nothing but a Pawn Shop and two lamp posts. It is the smallest planet seen in Rick and Morty, even smaller than Dwarf Terrace-9. Trivia: This could be a reference to one of Roiland's old shorts (Fantastimart), that can be seen here. Given the fact that no vehicle other than Rick's space cruiser was seen on the planet, it may be possible that he lives there, or it is possible that his car was just on the other side of the planet, invisible to us, at the angle it was shot at. Smidgen appears to be the accepted currency at this shop.
