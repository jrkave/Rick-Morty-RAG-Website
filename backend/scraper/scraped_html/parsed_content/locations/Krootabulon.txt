 Krootabulon is the home planet of the Krootabulan race. It can be assumed to have a different ecosystem than Earth and a harsher environment, resulting in the Krootabulans becoming a warrior race. A creature named Gorgon presumably lives on this planet and has the same role as a bull on Earth. Varrix may have lived here before Krootabulans started hunting them. Site Navigation:
