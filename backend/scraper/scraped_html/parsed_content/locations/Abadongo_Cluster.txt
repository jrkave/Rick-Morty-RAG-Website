The Abadongo Cluster is a cluster in space where the Abadongians live. The race is governed by the Abadongian Princess. Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith retrieved a crystal from a giant space monster and delivered it to the Abadongian Princess in the episode "Rest and Ricklaxation".  Trivia: It's unknown if the Abadongo Cluster is a Galaxy cluster or an open cluster.
