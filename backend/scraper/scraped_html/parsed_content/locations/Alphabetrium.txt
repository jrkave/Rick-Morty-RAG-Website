Alphabetrium is a faraway realm inhabited by an ancient race who resemble giant letters of various alphabets. It was ruled by a council, which consists of Magma-Q, Magnesium-J, and Hydrogen-F. After the end of the war between Alphabetrium and the Numbericons, they started to live on Alphabetrium together, united under the new nation of Alphanumbericon. History: It's the homeworld of Ice-T, an exiled native of Alphabetrium who became a well-known rapper on Earth. After Ice-T saved Earth from being destroyed by the Cromulons, the elders of Alphabetrium received word from across the galaxy of Ice-T's heroism and relieved him of his exile, granting him of his true form Water-T. Moments later, Alphabetrium was under attack by the Numbericons and Helium-Q dies when a ceiling collapses in him. Despite overwhelming enemy numbers, Water-T pulls out his guns and bursts through the doors, ready to crunch the numbers.
