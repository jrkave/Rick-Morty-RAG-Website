 Venzenulon 9 is a planet in the Venzenulon planetary system, orbiting its star close enough to sustain life during the day. During the night, the planet's temperature drops to -300F. History: In Morty's Mind Blowers, Morty saw when Rick believed himself and Morty to be stuck on this planet, and killed a local animal in order to keep warm during the extremely cold night. As night fell, it became apparent that they were in fact stuck on Venzenulon 7 instead.  Site Navigation:
