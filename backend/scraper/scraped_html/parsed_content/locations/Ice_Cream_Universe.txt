 An unnamed dimension known for having: A Ball Fondlers movie franchise, Giant Telepathic Spiders, eleven variations of the September 11 attacks, and what was once considered the best ice cream in the multiverse. History: Rick, Morty and Summer went to this dimension for the Ball Fondlers movie franchise, and decided to also check out the ice cream. However, the Space Cruiser’s battery wasn’t working, so Rick and Morty had to enter it to check the problem. Before leaving, Rick told the ship to “keep summer safe”. Following the protocol, the Space Cruiser killed a pediatrician and paralyzed his friend, both for approaching the car. The police tried to intervene, but were stopped after the ship scared them. This resulted in the military getting involved. To solve the situation without using physical or psychological methods, the ship contacted the POTUS of this universe and the Spider leader, and convinced them to form a peace agreement between humans and spiders. The President gave Summer and the Space Cruiser a pardon for their part in it and ordered the military to leave them alone. After the peace agreement, humans began making all ice cream with flies to make it "suitable for all beings, no matter how many legs", much to the anger of Rick, who now considers the ice cream ruined.
