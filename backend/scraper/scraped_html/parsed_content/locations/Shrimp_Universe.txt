The Shrimp Universe is a fascist reality where Earth's dominant inhabitants are descended from shrimps instead of apes.  History: Rick C-137 stumbled into this universe when his brain got uploaded to Shrimp Rick's clone body. Shrimp Rick seemed like a nice guy, but when Rick C-137 said "Honestly, you’re doing me a huge favor by being shrimp instead of fascists”, shrimp Rick turned out to actually be fascist and turned on Rick once he realized Rick C-137 was not a supporter. Rick C-137 was chased into town by officers and shrimp dogs, the latter of which soon caught him and caused his death. The Shrimp Universe makes a brief cameo in "Rickmurai Jack". Notes: All creatures present in this universe, both sentient and not sentient, are descended from shrimps. All the recent destruction in town points to one of two possibilities: either the fascist takeover happened recently, or there are still resistance forces fighting the regime. The Officers who chase down and kill Rick are shrimp versions of Heinrich Himmler (Right), the founder and head of the SS during World War 2, and Reinhard Heydrich (Left), a high-ranking SS officer and head of the Gestapo appointed by Himmler himself.
