Evil Rick's Target Dimension is a dimension on the Central Finite Curve that is the home to one of the 27 victims of Evil Rick's killing spree. History: This dimension appears to be very similar to Dimension C-131, meaning that either the Rick from this dimension successfully cured the Cronenberg epidemic or that it never happened. The Smith family is having breakfast on the eve of the one year anniversary of Rick's return. To show gratitude, Beth plans to make flying saucer shaped pancakes However, their meal is interrupted when Evil Rick and Evil Morty show up. Evil Rick shoots Rick in the head, killing him. The rest of the family starts screaming, but in the commotion, Evil Morty tranquilizes the Morty from this dimension where he is then dragged through the portal.
