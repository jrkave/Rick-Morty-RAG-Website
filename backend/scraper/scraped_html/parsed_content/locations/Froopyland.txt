  Froopyland is an artificially generated world created by Rick Sanchez from a collapsed quantum tesseract some time in the 1980s for his daughter, Beth Smith, when she was a little girl. It appears in "The ABC's of Beth". Rick outright admits that his reason for creating Froopyland was to sequester Beth, who clearly showed strong psychotic tendencies as a child, and protect neighborhood (though he immediately makes it clear that he didn't do so out of the non-existent goodness of his heart, but just so he wouldn't have to clean up any of Beth's messes). Rick mentioned that all other Ricks also made a Froopyland for their Beths. Description: Froopyland is accessed by drawing an entranceway with what appears to be a glowing purple piece of chalk. The inside of Froopyland consists of a massive area that includes mountains, forests, swamps, and likely other biomes. The weather is always perfectly sunny and warm with procedurally generated clouds rolling across the sky. A rainbow river of a cuts through the land with a stunning waterfall. The ecosystems are largely fantasy inspired as there are literal swamps of honey. Rick comments that the native wildlife has imaginary, procedurally-generated carbon DNA. Rick also included a fairytale-esque castle within Froopyland for Beth. Froopyland was designed by Rick to be an incredibly safe place for Beth to play in. All ground surfaces are bouncy to prevent injuries from falling, the rainbow river's water is breathable to prevent drowning, and all froopy creatures were designed to be harmless. However, after Tommy got trapped in Froopyland and started mating with the froopy creatures, the human dna gummed up their bio-carbons, mutating them, causing them to develop aggressiveness and predators attributes.
