The Screaming Sun Earth is one of 765 planets in the Milky Way that are at least 90 percent similar to Earth. Of those planets, it is one of three not under federal jurisdiction. It appeared in the episode "The Wedding Squanchers". The Smith Family rejected the planet as a choice for a new homeworld because the sun of the planet screamed at the top of its lungs non-stop, and the days there lasted 42 hours. Known inhabitants: None known, except for its parent star, the Screaming Sun.
