The Toilet Dimension is a universe in which the population is made entirely of sentient toilets. History: This dimension is briefly visited by Rick, Morty and Summer when Summer desperately needed a bathroom. Unsatisfied with the bathroom in the Dog Dimension, Rick brought them to this world. Summer refused again to use the suggested bathroom, and they traveled onwards to yet another dimension. Trivia: It made its first and only appearance in the Rick and Morty Season 2 promo, The Right Bathroom. Instead of condoms, they use "commodoms" (a combination of commode and condoms). These can be found in dispensers in public bathrooms. They have a newspaper called "The Daily Clog", which is displayed on the wall in a public bathroom. Their version of wet wipes are called "Handy Wipes" and are sticks with hands at the end.
