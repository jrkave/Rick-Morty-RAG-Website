Universe C-XXXX is the dimension in which Bushworld Adventures takes place. There are two key differences between C-XXXX and C-137:  1) The Sanchez-Smith family lives in Melbourne, rather than Seattle.  2) The entire world's population has Jerry-level intelligence or lower.  2.5) As such, Rick C-XXXX has not cracked portal gun technology, and must travel by car. Formerly, Rick had a water pistol he erroneously treated like a portal gun. Recently, he has replaced this with a real gun. 2.75) Jerry himself is named Dougie. In C-XXXX, it is he who has mastered interdimensional travel, though he accomplishes this via bush wizardry rather than science. The name C-XXXX is a reference to the land of Ecksecksecksecks in Terry Pratchett's The Last Continent.
