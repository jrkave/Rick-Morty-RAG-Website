Glorfingr 7 is a planet that is home to a bunch of giant, gooey Wharborgarbors that are obsessed with engaging in very weird forms of sexual activity and being used as sex toys. The planet has a number of small mining villages. Wildlife: The planet is home to a variety of peculiar creatures. The most prominent of these are the Wharborgarbors, nicknamed "testicle monsters"; and the Derberuses, which resemble large two-headed dogs. The planet is also home to the Kalaxian Crystals, which when inhaled will induse a drug-like high.  History: It appeared in the episode Ricksy Business. In this episode, Morty accidentally transported the entire house to Glorfingr 7 by knocking over an unknown machine in Rick's garage. Morty, Nancy, and Abradolf Lincler all set off to find some Kalaxian crystals to send them back to their home planet again. During their journey, Abradolf Lincler was attacked by a gigantic, two-headed dog-like creature and had to be left behind. After they were transported back home, Abradolf was gang banged by a group of Wharborgarbors. It was also revealed that one of the people at the party was still there too, being gang banged along with him, except he was enjoying it. References â†‘ Albro Lundy.
