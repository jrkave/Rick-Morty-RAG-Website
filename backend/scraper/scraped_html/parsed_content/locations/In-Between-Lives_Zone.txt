The In-Between-Lives Zone is a place talked about in The Good Morty. It is similar to the concept of Hell. If a Morty dies, after living a life of disobeying the rules of The Good Morty, they will be sent into this area, where they will be tortured for 1,000 years. However, after that time is up, they will be reincarnated as another Morty and their memories of their previous lives and time in the afterlife will be erased and they'll be given another chance at life. The religion of Mortyism could possibly have been a lie by Evil Morty, but it was revealed in Mort: Ragnarick that people who believe in an afterlife have their consciousness drawn to a paradimensional layer of infinite energy, meaning that this afterlife could have turned out to be a real place for some unfortunate Mortys that disobeyed the rules yet truly believed in the religion. If so, it's unknown what would happen at the end of the 1,000 years since it wasn't explained whether the paradimension can actually reincarnate people who believe in reincarnation. Trivia: The In-Between-Lives-Zone was also mentioned in a podcast by Justin Roiland as the place where human/pig souls go to fight for the fetuses of the opposite species in order to reincarnate.
