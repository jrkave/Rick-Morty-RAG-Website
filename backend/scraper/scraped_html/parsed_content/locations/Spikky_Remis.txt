Spikky Remis is large planet, several times larger than Earth, that was stolen by Heistotron. Description: The planet has a giant red triangle on its surface, with yellow and black lines which extend back across the planet. In the middle of the triangle is an eye with a blue iris. The surface is green-shaded and cloudy, and the planet does not have an orbiting moon. History: Spikky Remis was "heisted" by Heistotron and stored in a chamber inside of a gigantic space station, between the planets Krumpf and Ouanis. The planet was destroyed along with all the other planets, except for Earth, when the space station blew up. Trivia: The large triangle with an eye is likely a reference to the Illuminati.It might also be a nod to the character Bill Cipher from Gravity Falls.
