Shongi the Living Planet is a living ball so massive that it is considered a planet. Its surface has a skin-like appearance and most of Shongi is covered in hair and mighty nipples which can provide delicious Molk to hundreds of star systems. The "planet" seems smaller than average. History: After the downfall of the Galactic Federation, a lot of jobs opened as "molkers" on Shongi for Gromflomites to attain a new food supply for the Galactic Federation. Trivia: This planet only appears in a video on the Galactic Federation website, shown as a hot new job after the Galactic Federation's collapse.
