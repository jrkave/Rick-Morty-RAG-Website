 The Vacuum Cleaner Dimension is featured in the post-credit scene of "That's Amorte". This dimension had similar events to the ones that happened in the Parmesan dimensionâ€™s 41-Kepler B, but with vacuum cleaners and plant people instead of humans and spaghetti people. History: In this dimension, plant people who died had their organs turned into vacuum cleaner bags, which were used by sentient vacuum cleaners.

All vacuum cleaners on the planet vomited dust after watching it.
