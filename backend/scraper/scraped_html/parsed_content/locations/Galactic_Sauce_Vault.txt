The Galactic Sauce Vault is a sauce bank space station located somewhere in deep space. It is a neutral zone where all known planets have deposited their most important sauces for safekeeping. It primarily employs Gromflomites as its scientists, particularly after the downfall of the Galactic Federation.  Some of the sauces kept there are: McD Salad Cream, McD Szechuan and McD Spicy Buffalo. The space station is surrounded by what appears to be chicken nuggets. Trivia: It is a parody of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. It is probably the last place to find McD Szechuan sauce.
