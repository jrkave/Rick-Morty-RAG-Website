 The Plim Plom Tavern is a tavern located at an unknown planet, surrounded by flat untamed terrain. It is not a very popular tavern as it has not shown to have a lot of customers. The bartender here is a Floovian. History: Rick Sanchez traveled to this tavern when he decided to give himself up to the Galactic Federation. He had one last drink while looking at an old picture of himself with Squanchy and Birdperson before walking outside with his hands up, being met with a large group of Gromflomite soldiers and arrested.
