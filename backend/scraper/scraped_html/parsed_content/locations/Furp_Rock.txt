  An unregistered cross-temporal asteroid, and the location of Furp Rock Plaza and Jerryboree. It appears to be a hub between universes. Given the proclamation by the shows creators that time travel will be avoided, it is curious what is meant by the asteroid being "cross-temporаl". It is a possible hint of it existing outside the confines of time and space and likely finds itself between all universes, dimensions, and timelines. Therefore, you can get here on an ordinary ship at the coordinates "3924917" according to Rick, flown there from your own reality. Coincidentally, without a portal gun, any Smith families from different dimensions can travel here freely using an unknown phasing mechanism. Anything in Furp Rock with less than 8 legs are considered to be handicapped or disabled. Furp Rock also hosts a nursery school for Jerry from different universes.
