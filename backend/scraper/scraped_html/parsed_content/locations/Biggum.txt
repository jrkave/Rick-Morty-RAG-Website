Biggum was a very large planet that got stolen by Heistotron, and was destroyed along with Heistotron's space station. Description: Biggum was many times larger than Earth and appeared to be a barren planet. The planet's surface has cracks and a huge crater on the planet's top, which indicates a strong impact from a large space object at some point. Biggum has a ring of moons orbiting it at an inclined angle. Some of the moons are about the size of Earth and Mars. History: Biggum, along with Earth and a number of other planets, was stolen by Heistotron and kept in a chamber inside the robot's gigantic space station. Kept between Krumpf and M-9999, it was destroyed when the space station blew up after both Heistotron and Randotron malfunctioned. Trivia: The name is likely derived from the character Tyrone Biggums from Chapelle's Show.
