 The Parmesan Dimension is the replacement dimension the Smith family moves to after Dimension C-131 was infected by Mr. Frundles. Due to lacking a portal gun and prioritizing getting away from Mr. Frundles, Rick rushed his efforts to find a new place to live, and had to forgo being as stringent about making sure the new dimension was virtually identical. The main difference is that everyone pronounces the word "parmesan" as "par-mee-zee-an" instead of "par-meh-zh-ahn". This dimension's version of the Smith family (strangely including Space Beth) died "of natural causes", although it in fact looks like they blew up, which essentially makes their cause of death the same as that of the Rick and Morty from the previous universe.
