 Jupiter is one of the many planets that participated in Solar War One in A Rick in King Mortur's Mort. It is part of Earth's Solar System. Description: Jupiter is an orange gas giant inhabited by Jovians. History: Jupiter was first mentioned in Something Ricked This Way Comes, when Jerry was suggesting objects that could be used to make a model of the Solar System. in A Rick in King Mortur's Mort, The representatives of Jupiter and many other planets reunited in the Neutral Zone to discuss the recent attack on the Sun, caused by the Sons of the Moon. When they found out Morty brought the Solar Scepter to the location, a war between the planets began as all the representatives tried to get the object so they could rule the solar system. Jupiter was the first planet to get the scepter, though it was stolen by the Mercurians shortly after. The Knights of the Sun later reunited on the Sun and used their power to end the war, while Rick brought the scepter back to the sun. The jovians embraced the peace and destroyed their weapons and spaceships. Trivia: The Knights of the Sun used to think all planets revolved around the Solar Scepter, and that if they didn’t keep it on the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn would “bump into each other”.
