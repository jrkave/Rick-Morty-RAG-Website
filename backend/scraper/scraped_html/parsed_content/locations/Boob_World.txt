 Boob World is a world mentioned by Morty in "Rattlestar Ricklactica". History: Morty wanted to go to this world, but couldn't since defeating the snakes (who somehow gained time traveling technology because of his interference) was counted as one of his adventures by Rick. Rick then asks Summer if she wants to go to Boob World, but she declines the offer. Rick expresses some disappointment that he missed out on the trip.  Morty, Summer, and Rick would go on to head over to Boob World in "Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion" (Known for its catchy "Boob World Song"). Rick and Morty explain to Summer that the reason they brought her along was because having a female visitor with them would allow them to get in for free, as Boob World had been going through controversy for some time and had rebranded itself as a female empowerment area. However, their trip gets sidetracked by Rick finding a deserted Gotron ferret. Rick allows Morty to make a choice between going to Boob World and acquiring all 5 Gotron ferrts in the universe. Morty chooses the former, but is rendered moot when Summer agrees to help with the latter.
