 Zeplar Prime was a planet used as a convention place for several Space Hitlers.  History: The planet was inhabited solely by alien hitlers from all over the galaxy. It was used for conventions where they would work together and discuss their plans. After Rick gave Jerry an technological armor suit so he could use his orbâ€™s infinite power, Jerry used it to detect evil around the galaxy and found out about Zeplar Prime, and then decided to fly there to stop the space hitlers. Upon arriving there, he was repeatedly shot by the legion of hitlers and, unable to control his power properly, Jerry accidentally shot a nuclear blast that destroyed the planet. At first he worried about having killed innocent life, but an alien news reporter later revealed that there was nobody on the planet other than hitlers, and that Jerry saved 30 billion lives by killing them before they could start their own holocausts. Geography: Zeplar Prime was a rocky brown planet, inhabited only by hitlers. It was full of gray and red buildings armed with artillery. All banners had a logo with Adolf Hitler's face on it.
