The Omniverse is a concept referring to the collection of every single universe, multiverse, megaverse, dimension and realm. The omniverse contains the worlds of all fictional works. In theory, the concept of the omniverse takes place in reality, it is based on the theory of the second-level multiverse, developed by Max Tegmark. The theory of the second-level multiverse is based on the theory of the first-level multiverse, therefore, the theory of the first-level multiverse will also be explained.  Level 1 theory: A prediction of cosmic inflation is the existence of an infinite ergodic universe, which, being infinite, must contain Hubble volumes realizing all initial conditions. Accordingly, an infinite universe will contain an infinite number of Hubble volumes, all having the same physical laws and physical constants. In regard to configurations such as the distribution of matter, almost all will differ from our Hubble volume. However, because there are infinitely many, far beyond the cosmological horizon, there will eventually be Hubble volumes with similar, and even identical, configurations. Tegmark estimates that an identical volume to ours should be about 10^10^115 meters away from us.   Level 2 theory: In the eternal inflation theory, which is a variant of the cosmic inflation theory, the multiverse or space as a whole is stretching and will continue doing so forever, but some regions of space stop stretching and form distinct bubbles (like gas pockets in a loaf of rising bread). Such bubbles are embryonic level I multiverses. Different bubbles may experience different spontaneous symmetry breaking, which results in different properties, such as different physical constants.  Fourth Dimension Trivia: According to Merriam-Webster, an omniverse is a spatiotemporally four-dimensional universe. Some people use "omniverse" as a synonym for "multiverse", although they are different concepts.
