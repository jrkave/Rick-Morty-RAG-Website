 Dimension Beta B-45 is an alternate reality in which butts are faces and faces are butts, it first appeared in Season 3 intro and was mentioned in Rick and Morty Issue 22 by Rick. History: Apparently this dimension is equal to C-137 with the difference that butts are faces and faces are butts, it is first seen inSeason 3 intro, when a butt headed Morty is caught masturbating by a butt headed Beth, it is also later mentioned in Issue 22, when Rick says that if he would want to be a-holes, he would go to Beta B-45 Trivia: Although Rick does not states that Beta B-45 is an alternate reality, the resemblance with the season 3 intro makes the belief that is a dimension. This joke appears to have been taken from the South Park episode, "How to Eat with Your Butt".
