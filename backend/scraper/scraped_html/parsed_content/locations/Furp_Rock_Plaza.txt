 Furp Rock Plaza is located on a "totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid". It is the location of Jerryboree as well as Dumpy Stumps, Worm Zone, Gump's Shrim (presumably a reference to Bubba Gump Shrimp), Ma Moo in Style, Space Gal, Clz'k Hut, and some other unrecognisably named establishments.
