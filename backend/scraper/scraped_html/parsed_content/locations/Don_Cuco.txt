 Don Cuco is a chain of Mexican restaurants found in California, USA. Rick and Morty ate there with Zick Zack just prior to his death. History: Rick and Morty were approached in a packing lot by Zick Zack, who requested to be killed by the great warrior, Rick Sanchez. Rick was flattered by the offer, but decided to get some lunch first. The three went to a local Don Cuco and enjoyed a meal while discussing how Zick Zack wished to die, which he had no real opinion of, as long as Rick was the one to kill him. While Rick was in the bathroom, Morty inadvertently made Zick Zack question the existence of Floop Floopian afterlife, prompting him to flee once Rick emerged to kill him. Storming out of the restaurant, he ran out into the street and got run over by a car. His soul was quickly pulled underground by evil spirits.
