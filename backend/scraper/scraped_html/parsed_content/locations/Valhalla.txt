 Valhalla is one of the afterlives of Earth, introduced in "Mort: Ragnarick". Living beings enter this afterlife if they die in battle in Norway, or if they are killed by energy from the Transdimensional Energy Relay. Description: Like Heaven, Valhalla has a paradimensional layer of infinite energy so it can preserve the consciousness of its inhabitants. Valhalla is mainly inhabited by Vikings that died centuries ago, but goats are also found there, and monsters such as Dracula can enter it as well. Dying in this afterlife is possible, but the person will simply respawn within seconds and with no injuries. The main respawn lobby is a tavern. The primary way to enter Valhalla is to “die in a glorious battle against a mighty enemy”. The afterlife seems to have low standards regarding this, as Rick was able to join it by simply dying to Bigfoot in a one-sided battle that only lasted a few seconds. The second way to arrive in Valhalla is to be killed by energy from the Energy Relay, even if the being died outside of Norway, as the relay is directly connected to Valhalla. It is ruled by Odin, although he never makes an appearance in the episode. Trivia: In real life, Valhalla is a concept that originates from Norse mythology.
