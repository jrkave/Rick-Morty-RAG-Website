Big Pluto was one of the many planets stolen by Heistotron and trapped within a gigantic space station. The planet has two moons, each about a third of the planet's size, orbiting itself at a really close proximity. History: Big Pluto was secretly heisted by Heistotron after it went rogue and started stealing entire planets. Big Pluto was placed in a chamber between Earth and Zipple, and was presumably destroyed in the collapse of the space station. Trivia: Due to the size of the planet's moons, it stands to reason to assume that both the planet and the moons orbit a shared point somewhere between them. The shape of Big Pluto and its moons is similar to the silhouette of Disney's Mickey Mouse (whose dog is named Pluto).
