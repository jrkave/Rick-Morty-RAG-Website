The Trumpdorian planet is the home planet to the Trumpdorian race. The planet's civilization crashed due to the inhabiting race's preoccupation with dancing instead of doing anything constructive. It was mentioned by Rick Sanchez when recounting what Morty Smith and Nestor were doing together. Race: The Trumpdorian race is a race famous for neglecting their society and allowing it to fall into chaos and ruin. They chose instead to perform their "Trumpdorian prayer dance" at all times. They are described to have two jaws and six hearts. Trivia: The name is an obvious reference to the American president Donald Trump. The "Trumpdorian Prayer Dance" is the flossing dance.
