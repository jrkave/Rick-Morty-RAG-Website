Dimension 437 is a dimension that was featured in Rick and Morty Issue 20. According to Rick, the problem with Dimension 437 is that 'the stupid local fauna can't mind their own business.' One of the animals there was a strange tentacle monster whose young grow inside the muscles of living beings. A resource found there is called 'blergdite', and it has unknown purposes.
