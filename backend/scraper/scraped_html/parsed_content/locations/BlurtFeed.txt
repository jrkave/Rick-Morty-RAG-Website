BlurtFeed is an intergalactic media, news and entertainment company, providing their products and services throughout the Galactic Federation. History: BlurtFeed established a new office on Earth after it became inducted into the Galactic Federation. The employees kidnapped humans in the city and chained them to desks where they were forced to write Internet articles until they died. Summer applied for a job at BlurtFeed, but did not get it. The office building was abandoned after the fall of the Galactic Federation. Content: It produces a number of pop culture articles on subjects such as lifehacks, memes, lists with advices or relateable subjects, and people trying something new. The "volunteers" brought in to try new things are usually humans forced by the BlurtFeed workers and left incapacitated or mentally scarred.
