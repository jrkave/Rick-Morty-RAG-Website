 Tamorus Lite is one of the many planets that were visited by Dinosaurs and eventually hit by one of the sentient meteors. It is orbited by three moons. History: After the dinosaurs made life on Earth harmonic, some of them left to improve life on other planets, including Tamorus Lite. The planet was presumably made into a utopia, but a meteor, which was part of a hate-filled species that targets dinosaurs, later crashed into the planet, killing most life and making dinosaurs go extinct there. At some point, their skeletons were found by a sapient beaver-like species. When putting together the bones, the inhabitants made the incorrect assumption that each dinosaur had two heads where their feet should be, and a tail where their head should be. They also named the dinosaurs “Skullfeet”. The meteor crater was also found, but was mistaken for a “land amphitheater” used by the dinosaurs to hold concerts. The planet was visited by Rick and Morty in JuRicksic Mort when they were investigating the dinosaurs. The two were given a tour to the “Skullfeet Museum”, where they realized how idiotic the inhabitants are. Inhabitants: The planet is inhabited by red beaver-like citizens, who live in slightly buried houses. Their society seems decently advanced in technology. Despite this, they are not very intelligent as shown by their poor research skills, as they got the dinosaurs’ anatomy completely wrong and thought their cause of death was “stepping on their own brains too much”.
