 Forbidden Zone is a planet that was visited by Rick Sanchez in "Night Family". History: The Night Family destroyed the Smith Family’s dishes in response to Rick refusing to rinse them after eating. However, Rick was still unwilling to listen to their request. He went to the Forbidden Zone, which had an alien that owed Rick a favor. Rick took advantage of this and made him create dishes that are 110% indestructible. Rick then brought them to Earth and told his family to use them instead. Description: The planet is surrounded by a ring of asteroids. Most of the Forbidden Zone seems to be stormy. The planet’s only known location is a base where an unnamed alien works as a blacksmith.
