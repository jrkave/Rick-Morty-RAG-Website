 Dimension 9-2184C is a dimension mentioned by Rick in the backup comic in Rick and Morty Issue 22 as a dimension "full of self-assured assholes" where people are "pieces of sh*t". According to Rick they have had twenty-seven World Wars and says "it's literally the worst place imaginable". Rick visited this dimension when Morty asked him for help with Jessica, and he brought back Confident Morty to flirt with her in Morty's place. Rick did not anticipate the crude language used in this dimension which disgusted Jessica and got Brad to beat Morty bloody.
