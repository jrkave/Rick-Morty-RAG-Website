Cogspot is an auto repair shop owned by Gearhead. It first appeared in the episode "Mortynight Run". History: Rick and Morty flee here with Fart to have repairs done on the space cruiser after it was badly damaged earlier in the episode. Gearhead later betrayed them and told the Galactic Federation that they were holding the Fart hostage. The shop was surrounded by bodyguards and was later ambushed, but to no avail since Rick, Morty, and Fart already escaped.  Trivia: A copy of a Queer Gear magazine was spotted on one of the pillars in the shop.
