Krumpf was a planet stolen by, and later destroyed because of, Heistotron. The planet appeared to be similar to Earth in that it contained both large bodies of water and land, though Krumpf had more land surface than water. The planet was also cut in two, with the two halfs slight split apart and showing the planet's core. Krumpf also had two moons, one larger and one smaller than the Earth's Moon. History: Krumpf was heisted by Heistotron, a robot created by Rick Sanchez to perform heists, and stored in a chamber on the robot's space station. It was placed between the two planets Biggum and Spikky Remis, and was destroyed along with the space station after Rick defeated both Heistotron and Randotron.
