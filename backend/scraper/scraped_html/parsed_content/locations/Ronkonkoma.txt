 Ronkonkoma is a planet that was once home to several Dinosaurs, until a meteor impact caused their extinction. Its only appearance is in JuRicksic Mort. History: After the dinosaurs finished making Earth harmonic, some of them left to do the same to several other planets, including Ronkonkoma. However, there was also a hate-filled species of sentient meteors that targeted dinosaurs, and one of them crashed into Ronkonkoma, killing all dinosaurs there. Eventually an sapient slug-like species rose and found the bones of the dead dinosaurs. When putting together the bones, the inhabitants got their anatomy slightly wrong, believing the dinosaurs used to be basket-shaped, with their tails directly linked to the head. Because of that, they were given the name of “Basketsaurs”. The crater of the meteor impact was also found, but the inhabitants thought it was a “dirt bowl” used by the dinosaurs to eat communal soup. This was the second planet visited by Rick and Morty when they were investigating the dinosaurs. The two visited the “Basketsaur Museum”. Inhabitants: The planet’s only known inhabitants are citizens that resemble slugs, but with arms and legs. Their color seems to vary between blue and green, and they all wear orange suits. A photo reveals they are born without legs and arms, and most likely only get them after growing up. They are not very smart, evidenced by their terrible research of dinosaurs. Trivia: One of Ronkonkoma’s citizens mentions they have been making “a series of increasingly terrible movies” about cloning the “Basketsaurs” in a theme park. This is another reference to the Jurassic Park franchise. "Ronkonkoma" is the name of a real city in New York.
