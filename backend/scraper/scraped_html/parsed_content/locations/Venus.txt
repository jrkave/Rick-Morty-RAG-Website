 Venus is a planet located in Earthâ€™s Solar System. Its representatives, the Viscounts of Venus, participated in a war against several other planets in A Rick in King Mortur's Mort. Description: Despite being the hottest planet in the solar system, Venus is capable of sustaining life, and is home to the Venusians. It has a yellowish atmosphere, and several statues of the viscounts can be found on the surface. The planet is governed by the Viscounts of Venus, mainly Lithdor. History: After the Sons of the Moon started an attack on the Sun, the Viscounts of Venus, along with the representatives of several other planets, reunited on the Neutral Zone to discuss the conflict. After Morty brought the Solar Scepter to the place, a war began as the representatives tried to steal it so they could rule the solar system. During the war, the Venusians were the first to use new technology to their advantage. The Saturnians also bought new tech, and attacked Venus by deploying sulphuric mustard gas into the planet. After the Knights of the Sun reunited on the Sun, they used their power to end the war. Lithdor still wanted to continue it, but after Rick stole the Scepter from him, he quickly gave up and agreed to end the conflict. Peace was maintained between all planets after Rick and Morty faked a sacrifice. Site Navigation:
