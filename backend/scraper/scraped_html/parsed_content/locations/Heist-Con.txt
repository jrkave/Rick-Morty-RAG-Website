Heist-Con was a convention hosted by the heist artist Miles Knightly. It was centered around heisting and featured booths, shows and activities related to the topic. History: Rick brought Morty to Heist-Con after begging him to go on an adventure. To go inside you need to cut a hole in the glass just like any heist where you're sneaking inside. To participate in the events you need to buy guest badges or professional badges although Rick refuses to buy a guest badge, the requirements of getting a professional badge is you need a heist crew of more than two people. The most recent Heist-Con had at least 3329 attendees. Information: This event was a part of Rick's plan to stop Morty from pursuing his movie career by using Morty's screen play and making it into a reality. Morty realizing his heist movie isn't as good or original as he thought it was going to be lost motivation and just decided to keep going on adventure with Rick which was apart of his plan all along. Notes: Heist-Con is clearly a parody of Comic-Con or any convention.
