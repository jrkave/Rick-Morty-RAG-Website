The Furniture Universe is a universe where furniture are sentient beings who use human beings as furniture, eat phones for sustenance and use pizza as phones. Giant bottles were used in place of municipal buses, and miniaturized heavy duty vehicles seem to equate to disposable bottles or cans to drink liquids. Strangely, even though municipal buses are built in the style of plastic bottles, normal cars are also shown to commonly exist here. In addition, most single-serving cans and bottles are made in the shapes of tiny garbage trucks or city buses respectively, while most fine glassware remains eerily typical. This suggests garbage trucks in this dimension resemble giant aluminum cans, though one is never shown in the episode. Besides the obvious, all other readily observable aspects of this dimension appear to be more or less unchanged.   History: Rick and Morty temporarily hid in this dimension after successfully evading the Council of Ricks. Trivia: Upon entering the dimension, Rick tells Morty that their escape method should "...keep them for awhile", possibly referencing the relative obscurity of the destination they ended up in. Previously, they had used the Pizza Universe and the Phone Universe as a means of egress before being tracked through both of them by the Citadel forces in pursuit. One of the the passengers on the bus is Rainbow Suspenders Guy, even though no other naturally occurring non-furniture humans seem to exist here.
