Planet Parblesnops was a planet destroyed in "Get Schwifty". It was home to a species called Greebybobes. It was featured as one of the contestants on the in-series TV show Planet Music, where they refused to play in the name of freedom and were quickly "disqualified." Nature: Parblesnops used to have a swampy environment with large overgrown water lilies, roots and vines. The type of environment frog-like creatures, like Greebybobes, would be expected to live in. The planet appeared rather flat, with few mountains or buildings visible. Water covered most of the planets surface with water lilies offering the only refuge from the sea.  Trivia: In the pilot episode, a Greebybobe was seen, having a conversation at Intergalactic Customs, saying that on his planet, they have a kind of food called a "Flim Flam."  Site Navigation:
