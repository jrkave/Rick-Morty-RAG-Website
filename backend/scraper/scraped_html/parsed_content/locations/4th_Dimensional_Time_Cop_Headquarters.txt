4th Dimensional Time Cop Headquarters is, as its name suggests, a fourth-dimensional base of operations for the Time Cops. It first appeared in the Season 4 episode "Rattlestar Ricklactica". Employees: Shleemypants Trivia: There are free-floating cats around the headquarters, which also appeared in the Season 2 opener "A Rickle in Time" around the Smith Residence. This was the first time we saw a Time Cop in the series, namely Shleemypants. The term "Time Cop" might be a reference to the film Timecop from 1994 where agents worked for the Time Enforcement Commission to prevent illicit use of time travel. Site Navigation:
