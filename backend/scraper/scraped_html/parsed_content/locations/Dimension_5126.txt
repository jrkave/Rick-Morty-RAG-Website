 Dimension 5126, also known as Season 2 dimension, is the dimension the series' main Jerry is from and where Jerry (C-131) briefly resided in. History: In the end of "Mortynight Run", Rick and Morty swapped their Jerry with a wrong one after they lost their Jerry's ticket in the Jerryboree. Jerry (C-131) began living in that dimension, here the divorce that began in "The Rickshank Rickdemption" and ended in "The Rickchurian Mortydate" never happened, as a result his life was worse than the Jerry he got swapped with due to not spending a brief time divorced. Later, after Rick accidentally reset interdimensional travelers, Jerry went back to his original dimension until the main family picked him up. This dimension's Smith family was left without a Jerry after the Jerry of Dimension C-131 turned into Mr. Frundles before he could get the opportunity to return here.

Regardless, this dimension has been officially labeled Dimension 5126 by promotional material, matching its Jerry's ticket number.
