 Titan is the largest of Saturn's many moons. It is where Beth and her children, Summer and Morty, were imprisoned. It appeared briefly in a memory in Morty's Mind Blowers. History: At some point, probably shortly after Jerry and Beth's divorce, the Warlord of Titan kidnapped Beth, Summer and Morty, and he brought them to this moon on a mountain, he tied and gagged the two siblings and locked them in two pointed spheres, while Beth was tied up and seated on a throne, the Alien made a proposal to the woman, telling Beth she can choose which one of her two children should survive and who should die, knowing that children are everything for a mother, while the boy and the girl were trapped in the spheres. Beth promptly chose her daughter Summer, much to her son Morty's disbelief, just before the arrival of Rick by a portal. After shooting the Alien, Rick explained that he confused Titan with Phoebe, another moon of Saturn, and later, he freed his daughter and grandchildren. Site Navigation:
