Morty Mart was a convenience store located at the corner of Fifth and [Belches] Avenue in the district of Mortytown in the Citadel of Ricks. It was robbed by the Mortytown Locos in the episode "The Ricklantis Mixup". History: The Mortytown Locos, a local gang in Mortytown, robbed this Morty Mart at the same time Cop Rick was partnered up with Cop Morty. They went to investigate the robbery, but only received a generic description of a regular Morty: 14 years old, same height as the manager and yellow shirts. Luckily, a duo of Mortys was spray-painting graffiti across the street and Cop Morty threatened them into telling who the robbers were.
