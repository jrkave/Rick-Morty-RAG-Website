 Heaven is one of the afterlives of Earth. It is based on the religious concept of "paradise for the faithful". Description: Heaven seems to be the standard afterlife that most humans go to when they die, with Rick describing it as being “for neurotypicals like Jerry”. It also requires true faith to enter, which is why Rick couldn’t as his mind was too atheistic. Heaven has a paradimensional layer of infinite energy so it can preserve the consciousness of its inhabitants. History: As part of an experiment, Rick Sanchez temporarily killed Jerry Smith eight times. In the first seven times, Jerry encountered his grandparents (Nana and Pop-Pop) in Heaven. In the eighth and last time, Jerry only encountered Nana, who stated that Pop-Pop had gotten tired of Jerry constantly dying only to come back to life later. Jerry was then brought back to life again, and Rick was finally able to confirm that Heaven existed and had infinite energy, which he wanted to harvest. However, Rick couldn’t access it as his mind was too atheistic, so he decided to go to Valhalla instead.  Trivia: Although Jerry Smith 5126 and Jerry Smith (Parmesan Dimension) died in the same dimension, Nana never mentioned there being two Jerrys in Heaven, implying that humans only go to the Heaven of their own dimension.Interestingly, the other afterlife Valhalla seems to accept inhabitants from any dimension, including Dimension C-137, Prime Dimension and the Parmesan Dimension.
