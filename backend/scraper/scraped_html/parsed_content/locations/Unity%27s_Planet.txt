 The planet Unity had entirely assimilated, and planed to use to assimilate the Galactic Federation. However, Unity left the planet with its people following certain events with Rick Sanchez. Unity's current plans for the planet are unknown due to the Federation's destruction in "The Rickshank Rickdemption". Inhabitants: Nippalians are blue-skinned humanoids with three yellow-tipped protrusions on their heads. There are differences in nipple structure as some have flat concentric nipple rings, and others have cone nipples.In the absence of Unity's control, the inhabitants instantly devolve into starting a race war based on their nipple differences. The unassimilated crew of the S.S. Independence do not exhibit this, but they may have all been of a similar nipple-type.The entire planet's population disappeared after Unity decided to leave Rick, and went to stay with Beta-Seven. Nature: The gravity on this planet is lower than that on Earth. The planet is covered with both green and blue grass, purple bushes and lavender-colored mountains. One mountain had Summer and Mortys faces sculpted into its side. Some trees have fluid-filled bladders full of tree blood instead of leaves. Location: Beta-Seven is referred to as a "neighboring hive-mind species" and it refers to itself as having a planet, so we can assume that it's planet is nearby, but we have no further relative location information.
