 Tusk Dimension is a dimension where humans developed tusks, but everything else is similar to most other dimensions.  History: Rick and Morty traveled to this dimension to meet with Elon Tusk, to recruit him for their heist to stop Heistotron. They met him at his car manufacturing company, Tuskla, where he agreed to come with them. Notes: It's evident that everyone has tusk in this reality. Everything is a pun of tusk, like the cars have tusk on the front of them maybe all vehicles has tusk too. The way Rick remarked that Elon has monster teeth, suggests that people's tusks vary in size, and having large tusks may be an embarrassment. Site Navigation:
