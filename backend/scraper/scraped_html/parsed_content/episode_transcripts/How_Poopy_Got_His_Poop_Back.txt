[START "HOW POOPY GOT HIS POOP BACK" TRANSCRIPT] [SIGHS] Any clue when our houseguestis finally gonna leave? It'd be nice to havethe living room back. I keep tripping on all his top hats. He's always messing with my TiVo! It's an antique, thebuttons are fragile! Big surprise that Dad'savoiding all this. Guys, he's a family friend. He can stay as long as he needs. Hey, so I just sold some dr*gs to the weird little dude in there. He said you had cash? Oh, you kids in school? - You having trouble focusing?- Okay, that's it! Morty, find your grandfather while I go talk to our houseguest. Jerry, pay the dealer. Yeah, I prefer the term "pharmacist." So do they! Any chance you have... Sorry, I left my wallet in space. Are you leaving to get it? [DOOR CLOSES] Mr. Poopybutthole,this has gone far enough. We have been really cool to you - in your time of need.- [GULPING] I agree, Beth. I'm a pieeeece of garbage.Can you boost me up so I can hook my beltto the ceiling faaaaan? We don't have a ceiling fan. Oo weee, is that why it's so hooot? They're not expensivvve. [SIGHS] Bet you didn't expect tosee me in a cold open, huh? Looks like I've takenanother turn for the worse. It all started when Beth sh*t me. - I said I was sorry!- I know... It tore you up inside... - Like a b*llet.- It was an accident! Anyway, then I got fired from my joooob, my wife left me, I broke both my leeegs, failed the bar exam. Ooo wee, things wentdownhill from there. So I've been crashing withthe Smiths for a while. Ooo wee, I'm Mr. Pooooopybutthole and this is "Rick andMorty" Seeeeason . ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [COMPUTER BEEPING] Hey, buddy. B-brought you a coffee. I can synthesize coffee. You don't need to make excuses - to come see me...- Yeah, I knew you'd say that, so I didn't even bring a cup. - Any progress?- Yes, Morty, I found the version ofme that k*lled my wife. - You just missed it.- Okay, I get it. I had a big sword fight withhim on top of Hoover Dam. He fell and landed on a sharp spike, and then whispered,"Thank you," like a werewolf. I was asking to be polite. The family wants you upstairsto deal with Mr. Poopybutthole. It's finally time, huh? Well, lucky for you guys, I knowhow to make someone leave. - Family, I present to you, Robo-Ghost.- Rick! - Your plan is to scare him away?- Avoidance much? I'm listening. AI VOICE: Assembling body. [WHIRRING] - [BEEPS] _- Activating sentience. [GROANS] Uploading business. _ - [SCREAMS]- Unfinished business detected. Terminating body. [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [SHOUTS] Okay. I need to make gravitypart of its finished business and leave floors unfinished. - Starting over.- Dad, you can't keep putting this off. - You're doing an intervention with us.- Nope. Then we're sticking Poopybuttholedownstairs with you. What is this? I-Is this an interventionof me not intervening? Y-You know this can'tmake the concept work, not comedically or clinically. Its success rate is % in both areas. Then you have to help him on your own. And not with a ghost. [SCREAMING] Oo, that... that's interesting. You kind of gave him a littlepower by mentioning him. There's a lot of scienceto unpack about ghosts... [SIGHS] After I talk to my friend. JERRY: He's in the living room, Rick. I'm not doing this by myself! Oh, so you're going tohave an intervention? No. I'm going to get some friends to help me talk to a friend,and you'd know the difference if you weren't stupid and had friends. You're mean! Dad! - Pick your battles, honey.- Ha ha! Yeah, f*ck you, Summer. - God damn it.- Your portal closed. Oh, did it? Have an intervention,or we'll intervention you, you bunch of stupids. [DOORBELL RINGING REPEATEDLY,KNOCKING ON DOOR] Gearhead! Buddy! Listen. We gotta help Mr. Poopybutthole. He's in a bad place. Well, that sounds like an intervention, which Gearhead no Likehead. It's not an intervention.And you owe me. Okay, fine, but now I need a drink. Make it to go and make it two. Rick, you son of a squanch! Squanch! Told you he wasn't dead. - We squanching?- A little. We need to have a hangwith Poopybutthole - and talk to him about...- His drinking. Us? Not without a squanch. - I'd love one if you're pouring.- Make it three. You left a Gromflomitefemur in the compost. Your human side ispassionate but careless. I also found your Federation hit list... Ugh! Don't go through my stuff! - This place is worse than prison.- [DOOR SLAMS] [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS] [DOORBELL RINGS] - Rick.- BP! It's been a minute. - Is... someone here?- Birddaughter. - You found her.- Yes. She was imprisoned in afemme fatale training camp. That's great! L-Let's go celebratewith our closest friends by encouraging Poopybuttholeto dial back his drinking! Suspect. But I findfatherhood exhausting and would like to show my daughter what real selfishness looks like. Perfect! Now, do we know anyone sober? - Have you been drinking?- On a Thursday? He seems ideal. - Waah!- So, where to? - A coffee shop?- No. He'll know something's up. Yeah! And I'm notsquanching just coffee! Let's squanch him to a bar! It would undercut our messaging. - So it is an intervention.- No! We're not asking anybodyto stop drinking because we're not hypocrites or squares, we're just concerned friends. Then we can at least do itat a place with a bar. Look, I think if it has food,it's allowed to have a bar. [SCREAMS] [THUDS] MR. POOPYBUTTHOLE:Appreciate you guys taking me out. It's been a rough week. Amy's taking pilaaaatesfrom a guy named Guy. You've been surveilling your ex-wife? Oooweeee, not withthe restraining order! I hired a Predator to follow her around. You can hire [BURPS] Predators? Yeah, they're cheap becausethey live for the hunt... you just have to pay 'emto not k*ll your target, and if they stay cloaked,there's no licensing fee. Welcome to f*ck You's! My name is Mart, and... f*ck you! See, at f*ck You's,we lightly tease our customers. Oh, this is fun! What do you know, Gilligan? [CHUCKLES] Nice! Look at this depressed pencil eraser. Did some middle schoolerstick you up a cat's assh*le? I bet you had everything and you watched it slip throughyour powerless little fingers like the sands of time. Be right back to take your order, folks, or should I say, f*ck! Perhaps this wasn't thebest place to do this, Rick. What are you talkin' about? This is a great place tocelebrate my birthdaaay! Birthday... Birthday... Birthday... Birthday... - Birthday... Birthday...- Your birthday? Ooo weee. I can't believey'all remembered! I was at the end of my rope, thinking I'd worn outaaall my welcomeees. Thanks for doing all this, Riiick! O-of course, Mr. PB.What are friends for? Heard we got a birthday boy?! Yeeeah, but please don't sing or... Yah! f*ck you, shithead! _ Haha, yeah. That sure is a smart hat... Because even my son Poopy Jr. hates me! [CRYING] Ooooweehehehe! I can relate. Birddaughter is a total bitch. If you're a parent, you can say that. Weeeell. Should we do shooots? Rick? Let's get riggity-riggity-wrecked! - [ALL CHEER]- ♪ I-I-I take a sh*t ♪ ♪ Do a pop, blow aline, huff turpentine ♪ ♪ Get wrecked, text your ex,fight a cop, feeling fine ♪ ♪ Punch your d*ck, turn some tricks ♪ ♪ Quit your job, buy a dog ♪ ♪ Have two beers, then ten more ♪ ♪ Pop a pill and meet the floor ♪ ♪♪ - [SLURPS]- That one's not my bellybutton. Well, what is it? ♪♪ [SCREAMING] ♪♪ Oo weee! [LAUGHTER] Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Hold on, everyone! - Whoa!- Ah! - Oh, God!- Oh, woah! I can't breathe! I can't breathe! Is there a restroom?! At the front. [GRUNTS] MR. POOPYBUTTHOLE:Oh, it was a bad idea! Oooo weee! - Yeah, ha ha!- Oh, man! [BRAKES HISS] [ALL GROANING] Oooo weee! - [DANCE MUSIC PLAYS]- [LAUGHTER] - Whoo!- Aah! Oh, sh*t, it's happening! Honey rave! Bee time, baby! Whoa, what world is this? - We're on Earth.- How do you know? Because I think that is Hugh Jackman. [MUSIC CONTINUES IN SLOW-MOTION] Oh, sh*t, it is. Hey, Jackman! Makes sense he recognizes me.We both hosted the Oscars. It's a pretty exclusive club. Listen, guys, don't make this tacky. Nobody call him "Wolverine."Just treat him like a regular... Gene! Small world, mate! Hugh! Hugh married my cousin. Which I guess makeshim a Wolver-ine-law. Ha ha! That is fantastic! Hey, didn't you host the Oscars? - Yeah, I, uh...- All right, all right, listen. Now, I'm not assumingyou guys want to party with me tonight, but if you do... - Ooo wee!- I wanna party with Hugh Jackman. - Squanch yeah!- If you do, you do it together, as a team. Now, I need to go take whatI call a "Huge Ackman." Ackman is Australian slang for sh*t. Don't look it up. Do make a decision. Because from here,I'm heading to the Jack Shack. - What's the Jack Shack?- It's just his house. But, guys, I don't thinkwe should go there. I challenge you to explain why not without making us want to go more. Well, Hugh's pretty anti-limitation. When he parties, it gets extreme. Challenge failed. Woah! What's extreme by the Gene metric? Does he have "Les Mis" sh*t glasses? We're not exactlysquanchweights, brother. It's my birthday, and I wishto party with Huuugh Jackman. ♪ Then you shaaaaaalllllllll! ♪ - That was a fast sh*t.- But first everybody's taking these. What are they? Huh, maybe they're Tic Tacs.Maybe they're cyanide. [CHUCKLING] Maybe I don't like to party with people that hesitate. Heh heh heh! There you go! That's the spirit! Now we're all completely... ♪ Fuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh! ♪ [CHANTING IN HARMONY] This was not oversold! "A, B, D, E"... I lost my "C." My alphabet has no "C"! Did I do these already? D-Did I ask that already? Squanch, yeah! My turn! Did I win? ♪♪ - Mm. [SNIFFLES] Mm.- Ahhh... The best bloody day of my life. My wedding was pretty great, too. I was talking about the Tony award. Yooohoho! Pull! - Yeah!- Woo-hoo! We're squanching now! Why the long face, mate? Shape of my skull. You know, Mr. Poopybutthole, when I wrote "Caribbean Queen,"you know what my agent said? - Billy Ocean wrote that...- That's what he said. Exactly that. "Billy Ocean wrote this. Don't write it again.You're not Billy Ocean." You know what I did? I fired my agent. Don't accept other people's limitations. What does your heart want, lil' ripper? Right now, don't think. Right now, my heart wants Amy back. Everybody! Our friend wants Amy back. - Squanch idea!- I will agree to anything in this state. I do not think that's a good idea. Ladies and gentlemen!This man is a fake friend! - Come on, Hugh.- "Come on, Hugh. Come on, everybody. Don't call Hugh Jackman Wolverine. Don't call yourself Billy Ocean. Don't get Amy Back." You're a vampire, brother. You feed off other people's energy. - That is kind of true.- Are you kidding me?! You've been living on mydaughter's sofa for months! - Do you want me to leave?- The entire family does! - Why not say something?- Because you're my friend! A real friend would haveknown it's not my birthday. [LAUGHING] Oooooooooh, sh*t! Fake friend! You're not helping, Hugh Jackman! Yoooooou do not tell meeeeee what to do! - Or anyone here.- Affirmative. - Woo!- Yeah, baby! Why would you pretendit was your birthday?! You think I don't know ahalf-assed intervention when I see one coming?! Oooooooooooooh, sh*t! Mm! I love where you are, man. You're just Wolverining rightnow. You... You feel that? I think so. Does Wolverining hurt a little? TOGETHER: Every time! All right, grab a drinkto go, gentlemen. Because we're either getting Amy back... or... we're going home. - You're nuts!- Then nut me up, bitch! Nut me up! TOGETHER: [CHANTING]Nut me up! Nut me up! - It's not an expression!- Woo! - Ha ha!- Amy's coming back dead or alive! - Woah!- Haha! - Yes!- Yeah! Fake friend, my ass. I know how to be there for my friends. [GROANING] Father?! Why?! Ah, crap. Hang on. Lemme go upstairs and grabthe business finisher. From where I'm sitting, you're the one with unfinished business. Hey, mind your own business. Business is my business! And, brother, business is good. [SIGHS] [INSECTS CHIRPING] Oh, you come back to ruin our fuuun? No. To help you finish this.

I came to say I don't knowwhat to do without you, but I guess I can startby not kidnapping. That's definitelywhere you should start. [GROWLS SOFTLY] I'm... sorry, Amy. You should be. But I'm not. We're a family now... Me, Poopy Jr., and Gul'Karna, Clan Leader of The Skin-Thieves. Goodbye, Wayne. Goodbye. Ooo-weee, a musket? I'm starting to thinkit's like their currency. I hunt because I must. But man possesses a preciousgift... the power to change. More like the power of music, bitch! - What the f*ck?!- Jesus, Hugh, we were just resolving it. Well, I'm an actor, and I'm high. "'Caribbean Queen,' written by Hugh Jackman, age sixteen." How's that for a twist? Confusing. Well, sometimes you have to believe. Wow, that's reeeal inspiring. Makes me think of how... - Get the hell out of here!- Okay, okay, sorry! All right, guys, I'm buyingdrive-through tacos, but nobody tells my nutritionistand we have to steal a car. ♪♪ RICK: "Wayne," huh? Oooweee. But I prefer Mr. Pooooopybutthole. More refined. [PHONE BUZZES AND CAWS] It appears Birddaughter has brokeninto another Federation compound. I must go. Wayne, this counts as attendingyour actual birthday. Rick. It was... canonical to see you. Yeah, let's call it. I wanna pass out beforeI remember what we did tonight. I never want to forget it. And I never want to repeat it. Proud of you, little buddy. You too, Squanch. Awww, f*ck! Look at us! A bird guy, talking cat,uh, what are you? A robot man, and a mutant. Wow. Was a bonzer night, mates! That's one for the books. MR. POOPYBUTTHOLE:Oooo, bonzer night indeed. Kept in touch with theguys over the years. As much as ya can in this fast world. Birdperson went hometo take on a challenge way more difficult than a Predator... raising Birddaughter. Gearhead went back to The Gear System and got a spinal replacement. He's still paying it off. Squanchy? Checked himself into a nice rehab. No one thought it wouldstick, and it didn't. He was later arrested for smugglingtoad venom across the border. Hugh Jackman went to the Jack Shack to glue back together theTony award that Gene sh*t. And possibly to put a b*llet in all future Wolverine references. Thanks to us. And what came of Rick? I think he learned something that night. About friendship. About honesty. And maybe he learnedsomething about himseelllf. Oh. Here. Forgot togive you a fading pill. Great for hangovers. Just to clarify, I-I had to take an un-fading pill to counteract the originalfading pill I just took. Oh. Uh. Okay? And if you're hung up onwhy the taxi disappeared, the... the pills aren't sentient, but they do detect human coverings, so it saw the taxi as somesort of large overcoat... doesn't matter. You, uh, gonna be all right? Got a place to stay? I can D print you anapartment on the moon. I'll figure it out, Rick. Thanks. Well, here I go pill'in again. Yep. Don't any of you worryabout Mr. Pooooopybutthole. I got a lot of work to do, but I'll land on my poopy little feet. I always do! Owww! This burns like hell! How did the other guys not react? Is mine different? It's like my skin is boiling! Guys, I got the Best Buds Burrito Box! They normally ask forproof of friendship, but the cashier trusted methat you guys were out... ... heeere.
