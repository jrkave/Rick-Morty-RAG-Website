Hello? Hello? - Hello, Jerry.- Nana! Are you ready to come to the light? Uh, I'm not sure. Where's Pop Pop? He's not coming out to meet you anymore because honestly, Jerry,this is getting annoying. It's not my fault! My father-in-law asked me tohelp him gather data and... Agh! Not agaaaaaain! [GASPING] Okay, run diagnostics. [MACHINE WHIRRING] Holy sh*t, this is consistent. - This is real.- What have you done? You've got my grandparents pissed at me. They'll forgive you because... they're zero-massfields of consciousness preserved by a-a paradimensionallayer of infinite energy? Morty, there's kind ofa heaven! Kind of! I-I mean there definitely is fora neurotypical like your father. His conscious connection to alocalized cultural model of infinity functions like a wick,sucking his little mind straight towards a sourceof energy strong enough to support collective projection. Great, so there's a heaven. Glad you could learn that bym*rder me eight times. He's got kind of a point, Rick. If you want to get into heaven, can't you just stop being an assh*le? First of all, I don't wantto "get into" anywhere. I want to tap thisparadimension's energy. Secondly, you wouldn't catch me dead in Jerry's generic-ass 1980s concrete and fog machine heaven. Well, guess what?You aren't welcome there! You raise a good point,Jerry, obviously by accident. My intact consciousness is too atheistic to get channelled to anyafterlife worth robbing. It's a paradox. Unless... Morty, pack your parka. We're going to Norway. [GROANS] Or I can augment your skinwith subdermal heaters... I'll pack a parka. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Infinite energy, Morty.

That's why I got Bigfootin this Poké Ball. Bigfoot is your enemy? Well, I doubt he's a fan.I stuffed him into a ball. I mess with him all the time. These Vikings don't havereal tight bylaws, Morty.
