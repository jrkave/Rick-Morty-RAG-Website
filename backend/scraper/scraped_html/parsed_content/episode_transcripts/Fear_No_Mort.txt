I'm gonna rip out your spleenand feed it to your husband! Uh-oh. Wouldn't want that. Yikes, Morty. We'd betterrun before it figures out what a husband is. This carnival of nightmaresused to be scary, right? - Ah. We've seen too much.- It sucks, you know, 'cause it's fun to breakoff a scare now and then. Did I hear you fellows wishing forsome good old-fashioned scares? I mean, I more wishyou wouldn't eavesdrop. Yeah. Who are you? Does the suit mean you work here, or that you super don't work here? Like yourselves,I'm a connoisseur of fear. I'm also originally from Earth. And did you know Earth is the home of the single scariestplace in the galaxy? I can show you if you like. We were headed that way anyway. Take a left. Almost there. We know where Earth is. For guys like you, youknow, who've seen it all, there's only a few realfears left to conquer. And one of them is right down here. - Okay. What the hell?- Yeah. This is punching down. Denny's is a nice chain thatgives people starchy food - when they're up late.- It's a hack joke, buddy. No. This is the place.Good luck to both of you. I'm gonna get myself a slam. He just wanted a ride, right? He certainly took us for one. Well, as long as we're here. Okay. Lumberjack slam, grand slamwich, pancake puppies, slamburger,two milkshakes... and an order of cheddar tots. Let me know when you want your cheque, and if you're here for the Hole,it's in the men's bathroom. - The what now?- Hole? The Fear Hole. Men's bathroom. Well, it's definitely a hole. They weren't lying about that. Is that hair? Seaweed? Boy, it's really circlingthe whole rim, huh? Guess you got to jump inwithout touching the sides? You think there's spikes on the bottom? I don't think they want youto go in there and just die. What kind of business would that be? Well, they're not drowning in money. They still have a built-in TV/VCR. - _- MORTY: Hey. It's that carnival guy. Oh, so he gets a kickback. Hi. Welcome to the Hole. Here's how it works. You jump in. The Hole manifests your greatest fear. You conquer that fear, andcome out, well, fearless. And you get your picture on the wall. What does the Hole get out of it? Well, you know those fish thatnibble dead skin off your feet? Yeah. The Hole's kind of like that. It eats fear. You win. It wins. Have fun and enjoy the Hole. WOMAN: Hey, Gaddafi, cool your jets with a taste of Mountain Dew. This has been here since VHS tapes and there's only three photos? Yeah. My tots are getting cold. So, you don't want to do it? - Do you?- I mean... It says it takes awayyour greatest fear. Rick: My greatest fear, Morty, i  s trusting a gross holeto conquer my fear, and I conquer that fear by walking away. Okay, fine. [YELPS, PANTING] Rick: You little turd! [SCREAMS] - Oh, God!- Oh, God! [SCREAMS] Hold still while I stuffyou with maggots. Morty: Rick! Rick: Okay. The Hole thinks I'mscared of not having a gun? [GRUNTING] [LAUGHS] Fear conquered! [GRUNTING] Rick: Check out them gains. Morty?Where are you, Morty? Let's go. - Oh, jeez. Oh, God. Oh, jeez.- Oh, man. We both sh*t our pants. - Christ, Rick. My button.- What a f*cking ride. - Maggots! In my button.- f*ck, yeah. - On the wall, f*ck!- It's not worth it. Not worth it! Beth: Oh, my God. You both reek. - What is that?- Morty and I sh*t our pants. You're looking at the two newestmembers of the Hole club. Summer: Uh, okay, sluts. - [SCREAMS]- What the hell? b*mb almost k*lled her. Take care of our wife. Diane: Rick? No. Oh, my God. No. No! - Mom?-  Diane: Where am I? Who are you people? Beth: You're my mom, but you're young? - Rick, what's happening?- Wait. Rick? Summer: What the fuck, Grandpa? Say something. Okay. We're clearly still in the Hole. That's exactly what I was thinking. We never left the Hole and... And part of the Hole is thinkingyou left the Hole and then... And then it can really dig into you. Because you can't really be scaredof anything if you know you're... BOTH: Still in the Hole. What the f*ck are you two talking about? Why is dead Grandmaalive in our living room? Diane: Rick, why are you old? Rick: All great questions. You guys get reacquaintedwhile we grab some equipment. Wait. Are we sure this isn't,like, a double mislead? A double mislead like wewent into a generic fear hole and then coincidentallycame home to that? That's... That's my wife. From the day I lost her. Well, what's it got to do with me? - Rick.- Right. I think I figured it out, Morty. Your greatest fear isme getting Diane back - and being happy again.- What? Why? Because then I won't need you. Look how scared you'regetting just talking about it. Morty: I'm not scared. I'm insulted. What kind of backhanded-asstheory is that? My greatest fear is you hooking up? Rick: You're right. We can't knowfor sure until I get more data. All right, family. Who wantsto catch up over ice cream? I knew he was working on teleportation. But wouldn't this be time travel? Oh, Dad never touches time travel. He calls it the Long... The Long Island Iced Teaof science fiction. Yes. But then, what... what is this? Don't worry about it. It's not real. Okay. I figure it's betterto do this in front of you. I didn't want to walk in De-aged. What do you think, D? 45? Younger? I don't care about your age, Rick. I don't even want to call you that. That's my husband's name. - He just d*ed.- I know. So, 27? Dad! You're traumatizing her. What? It's my face, too. And now Diane gets to understand that I'm still sexy and a genius. [SCOFFS] What a kindness. You were right, Rick.I'm really terrified right now. Terrified of what? If you don't mind,I'd like to get to know the adult version of my... Oh, my God. Where's my real daughter? Sweetie, it's all right. This may as well be our real daughter because she's just as real as you. - What?- Put it this way. You're all basically NPCs. Only Morty and I are real, so your side quests don't matter. - The main quest is us.- You're disgusting. You're talking about our babygirl like she's theoretical? Welcome to the family. No. You don't get it, honey. Even if this was real, she'd be only a version of your daughter who could also be aclone of your daughter. Stop wearing my husband's face! You're nothing like him. Because I lost you! Maybe you didn't deserve me. You want to hear a new theory? Maybe your greatest fear is getting a second chancewith her and blowing it. You don't think that fear'sbeen pretty well faced? Then you haven't conquered it. Or accepted it. Or something. - "Or something?"- I'm not a fear-ologist. Morty, all Rom-coms have an arc. Even "You've Got Mail" beginswith Tom Hanks k*lling that cop. - Really?- I don't know. I'm not going to f*ckingwatch "You've Got Mail." I'm doing this for you, Morty. The sooner I get her back, the sooner you can conquer your fearof being a useless, lonely turd. You don't think that's been faced? _ ♪ Hello, Diane, here'sthe song I rehearsed ♪ ♪ You had a bad day andRick made it worse ♪ ♪ He felt bad, so he created me ♪ ♪ I deliver you waffles and an apology ♪ Why do I have memoriesof being a human child? - Why would I need...- sh*t, sh*t, sh*t. God damn it. There wasa whole second verse about inviting you tothe zoo with the family. I've seen that robot's arms. Yeah. I used them on alaw enforcement drone that the feds had me build. It's how we, uh... How I met my wife. The zoo sounds nice. And this one time,we raised a civilization living on a zit on my face, and Grandpa helped merule over it as queen. It sounds like you guysare a real family now. I wish you could'vebeen part of it, Mom. Oh. Oh, honey. Rick, is there a deadline onthis theory you're chasing? Uh, yeah, sure. Uh,that's a good idea, Morty. Do that. [QUACKING] I always wished I knewwhat they were saying. Your Master's thesis.Non-human intelligence. When did you read that? After you were gone. It helped me develop this. f*ck you! f*ck you, Greg. - f*ck you, Lisa. Yum, bread.- No, - f*ck you.- f*ck you. There's bread. I guess that's what I expected. Anticlimactic, isn't it? Yep. They kind of suck. [BOTH LAUGHING] Hey. Want to grab a drink? - Hey-hey!- Woo! Yeah. All right. Woo! [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING ALIEN] _ So, when did you stopbeing a lightweight? Kept looking for my wifeat the bottom of a bottle. You're pathetic. Hey. To being pathetic. - Clear!- [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [BOTH BELCHING] _ _ _ [RETCHES] My turn. My turn. [RETCHES] [LAUGHS] I'll tell you what, old man. Seems like losing me madeyou cooler. [CHUCKLES] I should die more often. [BOTH CHUCKLE] You did. You d*ed everywhere forever. You're the only thing I can't replace. Okay, okay, Mr. Weepy. I'm not even real, remember? Nothing's real. That's your jam, right? My grandson, our grandson,thinks this is happening because my greatestfear is letting you go. Then don't. - I don't want to.- Then kiss me. I'm old, and we have puke mouth. Well, I'm not here,and it's not real puke. - Okay, Rick... Whoa! Dude.- f*ck you, Morty. - It's a blazer.- That's not what I meant. You look sick. The Hole is feeding on you. I thought it's supposed to eat my fear. Can we get some f*ckingrules up in this hole? I don't know the rules.Maybe you're dying because you've been in here too long. Interesting theory. I wonder why you're so rosy-cheeked. - What are you saying?- Maybe the real you is off somewhere running from spiders. Oh. So, now I'm not real? Yeah. Maybe my greatestfear is having to tell you to f*ck the f*ck off. - Go ahead and face it.- f*ck the f*ck off! Hey. Ready to Showbiz Pizza? Let me see that bear play banjo. Here's one for you. I'm afraid of watching you die. I like that theory, Morty.So, stop watching. Okay, this is it. You nailed it. My worst nightmare. I'd like to leave the Hole now. Hey. Hey, Hole, I'm talking to you. Are you listening? [THUNDER CRASHES] So, what are you? Like, the Hole? The Hole's promoter? - The Hole's intern?- Is there a hole here? Right. I'm supposed to goin there and be shocked that there's no hole,or that there is a hole. What difference would it make? Hmm. You are hard to scare. And Rick isn't, right? The Hole's gonna, like,suck on him forever because his big secret isthat he's got the most fear? Well, we can certainly say you'renot afraid to be reductive. I doubt your grandpa has more fear than the average assh*le in a Denny's. - MAN: Hey!- Sorry. If anything, he seems pretty brave. He's certainly not afraid to die. Maybe that makes hisfear extra-delicious. So, what, he's scared of love? Everyone's scared of love, dipshit. You learn that in your 20s. It takes a very rare,very powerful being to be terrified of happiness. - Dumb.- You're dumb. That's why you're notscared to be happy. The smarter you are, the more you know. Happiness is a trap.It can't last forever. Let's say you meetthe love of your life. Well, it's still gonna end. It's inevitable, whether bythe slow pull of a disease, or the shock of loosefooting on a hiking trail. Whether it be the corrosionof two personalities that reshape each otheruntil they're incompatible, or maybe the old stranger in a bar who says the thingsthat need to be said, to that person, that night. The point is, happiness always ends. Best-case scenario. Think about this. Best case is that youdie at the same time. Yikes. Can't the Hole just let me go, then? - Sounds like I don't matter.- You don't. But if you go, you'll take him away. Don't worry. Rick will diebefore accepting happiness. After that, we'll chaseyou with some clowns or some dumb sh*t like that. But Grandpa... [CHUCKLES] Yummy, yummy. Grandpa's gonna die. - Just like Diane.- [THUNDER CRASHES] [CACKLES] [THUNDER CRASHES] Sir, you've been in this boothfor a really long time. - One coffee isn't gonna cut it.- That's fair. - Want to split some pancake puppies?- No! [SCREAMS] Beth? Summer? Anyone? Dad, it's not real. Neither are you. If that's true, then you deal with it. You know what? You're right. - [SCREAMS]- [SCREAMS] - How about this?- Morty, what are you doing? Being scared. [SCREAMING] [GULPS] How is that not enough fear? You're the one scaring me, Morty. - No, no, Dad, it's okay.- It's not okay. That wasn't normal. [RUMBLING] My greatest fear is not being accepted. It should be. And you need to fear ita hell of a lot more. [RUMBLING] I can do that. You like that? Do you want to die? I have enough unaddressedtrauma to flood this hallway. - _- You f*cking idiot. This list says "Top Five Things," and you only wrote down four. [LAUGHTER] [RUMBLING] Trust fall. None of us touch orspeak to this kid ever. - [RUMBLING]- MORTY: Maybe take a picture, - send it to your friends?- Huh. - Not a bad idea.- [RUMBLING] How can we do the school playif Johnny has laryngitis? - There's no understudy.- Put me in the play. You don't know the lines. Yes, I do. "Three Days of Rain." I have it memorized. And I refuse to provethat until you cast me. Have it your way, but TheNew York Times is coming, and they're doing a featureon the current state of young American theatre. [RUMBLING] Perfect. It ended in a church? - What?- Yeah, they'd already d*ed. It was purgatory or something. How did your universe's version end? Hmm. Jack, Locke, and Sawyerteamed up to k*ll a fog monster and everyone got rescued. It was one season long,and it was perfect television. You can be great or you canbe around forever, right? True. True. True. True. - True. True.- Where's this going? - We doing robot role play?- True. True. - I've got oil at home.- True. True. True. - What was that? Diane.- True. True. - Diane? Diane?- Hey. - Stay with me.- Diane. Diane. - Diane?- Rick? - What's happening?- f*cking Morty. He's trying to hog the Hole. Come on. _ Alas, our father is dead. Walker, are you here? [CROWD GASPING] Uh, hi. I'm Walker. - Uh...- [LAUGHTER] Sure has been raining a lot of days. [RUMBLING] - What the f*ck is he doing?- [GROANS] What's wrong with him? He's naked. And why does he look sick? Because he's dying. f*ck. I got to get him out of here. But if I do, I mighthave to go with him. I don't want to. I don't want to, Diane. I think my greatestfear is letting you go. That's a good fear, Rick.Keep that fear. If you don't, you'll k*ll me. Again. I know. But I don't haveto k*ll Morty, too. How do you know he's even real? Look at his weird little balls. Goodbye, Diane. [GASPING] - Rick?- Shut up, Morty. DJ, drop that b*at.We got to conquer a fear.

You just looked real sad,which I'm afraid of. You know, of being responsiblefor your sadness. Which means I think wemight still be in the Hole. Huh. Well, I am definitely afraid of you ever knowing anything before me. So, yeah, I'd say there's a God damn it. Is this goingto be a whole thing? No word play, Morty. We have to figure out our actual fears if we're ever going to get out of here. - Actual fears?- Yeah. Tell me your f*cking fearso we can conquer it. I just had to crucify myself in order to save youfrom your Hole wife, and you think I'm the onewith unresolved fears? I ought to be afraid thatwe'll never get out, because you'll neveradmit that you're afraid. [BOTH GROAN] Okay. Good job. You conquered it, right? I think so. How are we supposed to know? No, no. This is real. I can tell. You're not afraid that you couldbe certain about something and still turn out to be wrong? - [GROANS]- You cowardly assh*le! How was I supposed to know? $8 for a side of bacon? Morty: [GROANS] Are you f*cking kidding me? Rick: It's a symptom of alarger concern, Morty. - If capitalism collapses...- Are we done here? I don't know. Aren't you alittle afraid at this point - of the Hole itself?- What? [GASPS] I swear to God,if we're still climbing out of this f*cking holetwo seasons from now... - Maybe that was it.- What? Maybe we needed to let goof our fear of uncertainty. - You know?- Right. I'd say we're pretty nativeto that at this point. - Okay. Thank you, Hole.- Thank you, Hole. We no longer need toknow if we're in you. So, bye. Are you afraid we're still in it? I mean, I hope we're not, - but if we are...- We'll find out eventually. Which no longer scares me. Rick: Same. Okay.

Hole Rick: Thank you for visitingthe Fear Hole, Morty.  Your fear of relying on Rick has been delicious. Dear God! Rick: Morty, how was it?  Was it spiders? Oh. Oh, jeez. Oh, my God, no. You... You didn't go in at all? Rick: No. It's a one-person ride.  You can't face twofears at the same time. If my fear was fireand yours was water... Morty: I get it. It's fine. I t really is fine. Huh. Rick: You do seem a little less burdened. Morty: Rick, am I irreplaceable? Rick: I mean, define irreplaceable. That's good. Good. I'm back. Don't! Or I won't know if I'm out. - Is it that good? Should I go in?- No! You holding out on me? You don't want to deal with it, Rick. There was messed-upmental sh*t in there. Like, Diane was in there. - What?- Not in a good way. Just trust me.
