[START "RICKFENDING YOUR MORT" TRANSCRIPT] [BLOWS RASPBERRIES] H-Hey, Rick... uh, needme for any adventures? - Huh?- Adventures? Remember those? Oh, y-yeah, not right now, Morty, uh, but d-definitely next week though. You been saying that a while now, buddy, so, I think I'm gonnagive you a little nudge by cashing in a few of these bad boys. Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're stilldoing the punch card system? Never stopped. Bam! Read 'em and weep. Fully punched cards, each entitling me to an adventure of my choosing. - I don't make the rules.- Yeah, I do, you little gremlin, and I definitely didnot stamp all these. You never remember to stamp the cards. - You're always drunk.- I didn't know we were still doing this! T-This stinks to high heaven, Morty.I'm not accepting these. I knew you were going to do this. So I got receipts, bitch. - I k... I kept notes.- This is gibberish. "Isle of the Mortysaurs"? "Takes One to Know One"? I make up titles for each adventure. You did the same thing for that MSreadathon at your school, Morty, - and you didn't read sh*t.- It's okay to lie when you're fighting Multiple Sclerosis! Or when you think you won't get caught! How are you going to "catch me"? Oh, you done and did it now, little man. That's your ass.Don't grift a grifter, Morty. I got friends in cosmic places. Yeah, uh-huh. I need an audit. Oh, right, you were already watching. - I'll come get you.- Wha-Wh-What is this? - I am The Observer!- You're so busted. Look at your face, you're so f*cked. I observe all! They observe all, Morty. - Cosmic all-seeing species.- So? So, they're basicallyuniversal police body-cams, but you can't turn them offbefore you b*at a minority. Or in your case, before youcook the adventure books! - I don't do that!- We gonna find out! Oh, I'm here for this! ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ I bet a solid % of these are bullshit. Oh, quit your bitchin' and do the audit. I-I got nothing to hide! All right, Observer,gimme "Truth or Dare." Christ, these names, Morty. - It's shorthand!- I have observed it! Now gaze upon me and so shall you... Two att*ck patterns and agiant glowing weak spot... "Legend of Zelda" tutorial-ass bullshit. I thought it was kind of fun. Halt, unidentified adventurers. We are the guardians of this sanctuary. One of us tells only truths,the other only lies. You ever f*cked this guy's wife? Yes. Well, how about that, he guessed right. I forgive you! - Oh, sh*t!- All right, next room. No, I wanna watch. Did you see how one of them lied? Fine, I'll call that one legit. I'm not here to nitpick,I'm here to find blatant fraud. Okay, uh, show me "Late Night Western." Morty, Morty, Morty, take me... drive me... take me... w-wan go western bacon. M-Morty, western bacon now. Ugh. Ohoho, yeah. - Before you say anything...- I knew it! Busted! You're banned from that Carl's Jr.! That doesn't make thedrive-thru an adventure, Morty. Invalid. Sounds like it's anyone's game! Well, n-no, it... it's nota bet, it's an audit. Observer, show us "MaximumOverdrive with Clothes"! [BOTH SHOUTING] At least this is better than cars. Cars can run you over. [SCREAMS] Okay, no, this is worse. - Boom. Adventure, suck it.- All right, fine. Uh, how 'bout "Whistlering Dixie"? Whistler! Whattaya got totag and bag these bastards? Made this lil' puppy after Ibagged my first neck-rophiliac. Double-action triggerspumping out , kilos of holy water per square inch. - Um...- This ol' girl's got dry-aged, Sicilian garlic expelling out at , feet per second, is swaddled by , Solar-joules - of raw ultraviolet...- Yeaahhh... ... and she's only getting started. I'm talkin' crucifix-shapedChinese stars, mirror-tipped wooden stakes, - and a... Wha...- [PORTAL g*n ZAPS] Hello? G-Guys? Morty, that was just anold man a rambling at us. - People d*ed!- So, by your logic, / was an adventure? - Tweet it, see who agrees.- Very well! Bear witness to / ! - What?- No! Dude, don't, just, y-you need to let usthrow to the stuff, okay? Okay, what's next? What the hell is "Leg Day"? Hey, look, Morty! I-I'm a leg! A leg, Morty! I'm Leg Rick! - Okay, I'll give you that last one.- What? - I-I mean... I mean, I'll take it, but...- Hey, Morty, check this out. That's clearly unlicensed. - License this!- Wait, what are you doing? Hey, Smith, you look hungry! How 'bout some knuckle pie? Wuh the huh? Aw, geez. Rick's implants. Big Doug... get the truck. Whoo! I've never felt so alive! Ayyy! Oh! Oh! Man. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Turn! Back! Into! A boat! I'm trying! [BOTH CRYING] - I'm trying...- Oh, Big Doug. Big Doug, no. [CRYING] There's my guy! C'mon, the hamsters turned on me, Morty. We gotta go. R.I.P., Big Doug! Wasn't even in that one! Who cares, i-it wasn't even on my list. T-This guy just cued it up! Speaking of cues, what about all those times youtwo misunderstood each other? Wait, what? Are you settingup a series of them? Trust me, the key is groupingthem with thematic connections. Uhhhhhhh... I-I just want to talkto Morty in private, about something unrelated. Yeah, we'll be right back. Okay, this guy might havebeen kind of a mistake. He's really, like, aggressive. He's steamrolling us. He thinks he's hostinga f*cking clip show. - And I don't like his voice.- I don't like his voice, I-I don't like that he's doing jokes, I don't like that he'stalking down to you. Thank you! Okay. Let's rethink this. I still don't trust these,but I'll accept these cards at cents on the dollar. Done. Fair. How do we get rid of him? Eh, I'll just pay the assh*leand tell him he did a great job. He thinks he's hostinga f*cking clip show. - And I don't like his voice.- I don't like his voice, I-I don't like that he's doing jokes, - I don't like him talking down to you.- Okay, well, that's... th-that's on us. - Should have seen that coming.- Seeing is more my thing. Well, then you knowhe's about to pay you. And "tell me I did a great job"? Fine, you caught us,we secretly think you suck. - Oh!- Here's twice what I owe you. That's how little conversation wewant to have about you leaving. I have never seen two bigger assholes! And I see all assholes! Then you can see yours out. Byyyyee. Christ. [MICROWAVE BEEPS] sh*t, hot, so hot. Gotta start in the middle,statistically the coolest. RICK: You won't find acarb on my plate, Morty. I'm all about that keto. - No.- Is that... Is that a f*cking... - Clip?- I'm a fats man. Gimme all the fats! That burrito looks pretty carby! This f*cking guy. That's your move? Diet shaming? Just take the L, man! Th-This is embarrassing. Oh, I'll show you embarrassing! Haaaaaaaa! Do it, Morty! I-It's the onlyway to save the universe! H-How? H-How is it the only way? Morty... I'm dying... it's up to you... Aahh! Rick! - Aghhh!- What the hell are you doing? Saving the universe! I think? Right, Rick? ♪♪ _ - This guy's nuts!- Screw you, Morty! What the hell? You told me I was a hero! - You were that night.- What the hell's going on? Is that angry stone playing videoclips? It's some weirdo Grandpa hiredto prove I'm a bad person. Turns out people that take thatjob aren't fun to be around. Get out of here! Sidewalk's public property, bro! I can observe all I want from here! This isn't our problem, Dad. Please make this loud thing go away. Yeah, I was studying for a test. THE OBSERVER: No, you weren't! f*cking rock assh*le. Now you've done it! As they've shamed me,so shall I now shame you! [KNOCKS ON DOOR] SUMMER: Mom?Are you drinking wine in there? Um... no, I'm sh1tting. Bitch, I know the soundof a toilet lid moving. - Woof.- Two birds, one stone. More embarrassing for Mom than me. I wasn't lying, I was going to sh*t. What's going on here? Cosmic being playingembarrassing clips out of spite? Damn, Jerry. Nailed it. I was watching from the upstairs window. Well, watch this, loser! Morty, I'm throwing out some stuff from our last couple adventures. You got any use for this diamond? MORTY: Nope. I'm good. This is gonna be fine. [SCREAMING] I'm sorry! I can't stop once I start! Whatever, everyoneknows I'm embarrassing. - I'm bulletproof.- Oh, my God, this is so sad. Not as sad as you after this! The so-called "Hottie Snatchers" have spread to Canada and Mexico, grabbing the most attractive residents and taking them God knows where. All Americans, even sub-sevens,are advised to stay indoors. You certainly wouldn'tbe safe out there. Not on the air, Michael. BRB, bathroom. I need to know! It's okay! It's not real, they'rejust doing it at random! [SCREAMS] Is everything okay? I heard a... [SCREAMS] [CRYING] You too, huh? It's not so bad once you get used to it. [CRYING] I don't deserve this.I just walked downstairs. Okay, well, if Dad'sjust gonna stand here, should I do something? Unless that somehow tees me up... - Walked right into it!- This is our target, Dichotomus Daniel... [FARTS] That was my chair. - It was a fart.- Birdperson always knows. It's true! He's got that beak! Get lost, you piece of sh*t! Why, so you can do stuff like thiiis? [SNORING] Ugh, Morty... I'm afraid the only way out is through the bottom of thismassive vat of whale semen. Well, that last one wasjust for shock value. f*ck this guy! Haha, if you can't take the heat, get out of the watchin'! You... You... You... You suck! S-Showing weird sh*t just 'cause we w-wouldn't let youtreat our lives like a clip show! - Yeah, get him, Morty!- Mess him up, little bro! What, you gonna b*at meup like the piss guy? Hey! Not cool! Why don't you tee up thisclip of me kicking your ass! Ow! Oww! Aghhh, I'm all rocks now! I never saw this coming... sh*t! T-These guys can die?! I-I thought they were cosmic! You know what, I say we leavethis thing in the street, deny any involvement, andjust hope this blows over. Unless, of course, they playthis exact clip on a screen in front of a jury withsome kind of built-in bias. As an observer, I try to stay impartial, but I am not seeing innocence. It's not blowing over, Rick. I'd tell you to stay positive, Morty, but I do not like thelooks of that jury. I can't believe we gotourselves into this mess over something as pettyas what an adventure is. Yeah, I-I guess I can admit I gota little loose with the stamps... Gotcha! Can the stenographer readback that confession, please? Silence! The k*lling of anobserver is unforgivable. We must now decide whetherto end your existence. Your Honor, if everyone herehas truly seen everything, then you all know my grandson andI did this whole thing with giants. Did what whole thing? I will address that! I'm your court-appointed defender. Your Honor, observe the time Rickand Morty did this with giants! This is an open and shut case, Morty. Y'know w-w-what do yathink is gonna happen, some magical angel'sgonna show up and... Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the violationof civil liberties! The moments are practicallyidentical, Your Honor. I move for a mistrial onthe grounds it bumps. If the argument is that Rick andMorty repeat their mistakes, the prosecution agrees! Oh, God, y-you sound justlike the guy we k*lled... uh, a-allegedly. That was my brother! I didn't like his voice either! Well, this isn't gonna help our case. Neither will this next clip! Morty, I made you a gorilla g*n. - Pretty cool, huh?- A gorilla g*n? - D-Does this do what I think it does?- Yup! Where's your lunch money, punk? Lunch money? Are you sure you wouldn'trather have... a banana? - [SCREAMS]- [CRASH] [CRYING] I thought it would turnhim into a gorilla. Why would you want abully to be a gorilla? It was a g*n that kills gorillas. Please go easy on him,th-this one's on me, and it won't happen again. - Morty, this is a bully g*n.- Whoa! Cool! - Any questions about it?- Not really. Yeah, should beself-explanatory. Have fun. Hey. Give me your backpack. - You trying to bully me?- Yeah. Well, how are you going to bully... another bully? What are you doing? [COUGHING] I feel like this one'snot entirely my fault. - Okay, how do you feel?- I-I'm okay. I mean, maybe just stopgiving me g*n, or... Or make them less ambiguous,way ahead of you. Here. Take this. This is a g*n, and I wantto be really specific here, this is a g*n that you onlyuse to sh**t bad people. - Are we clear?- Okay, Rick. When are you going to use that? When I want to sh**t a bad person. Okay. I had a great time tonight, Jessica. Hey. Give me your money. Why don't you take this instead? Jeffrey Dahmer? - Hi.- Uh, what's happening? I don't know, just run. Let the record show this bitcontinued for several more g*n. What are we even guilty of inthat one, being kind of dumb? For being dumb over and over! A-ha! But, Your Honor, is that notthe definition of experimentation? The foundation of science? And are Rick and Morty thereforenot only not not learning, but therefore actively learning? Observe this example! _ How long before BenFranklin comes back to life? Holy sh*t! Yes! sh*t, he came back evil. What do you think will happen - if we bury him again?- You don't know? This is my first time usingPet Sematary soil, Morty. I mean... as long aswe're asking questions... we've been here so long my phone d*ed. It's not gonna charge your phone! So you can be curious and I can't? f*ck, you're right. W-We're sitting on top ofbrand-new science here. L-Let's gather some data! [BOTH GRUNTING] - Put your back into it, Morty!- Y-You think it'll refill the t*nk? Good pitch, Morty! Okay, let's bury that kangaroofrom the waist down. Holy sh*t! Will only his legs come back? Who knows?! Hey, I'm having a great timewith you tonight, Morty! [ALARM BEEPING] - W-What's that one?- Ben Franklin! R-Remember we triedwrapping him in tin foil - to see if it'd shield him from the evil?- Oh, yeah. - [SIZZLING]- Ow! f*ck! - I-It's hot!- Jesus Christ... It cooked him like a pig at a luau. - It's so moist.- Rick! That's a guy! Man, what is this place doing to us? Is nothing sacred to you two? What are these clips? Wh-Whatare we even on trial for anymore? What's anyone on trial for, son? Being good or evil. L-Look, sure, we can be irreverent, but w-we're far from evil. We make more friends than enemies! Let's run the tape on that one! Hey, Rick, can you makemy churro come to life? On it! Hiiiiiiii! I'm Churry! Churry, do you want to have fun? Let's go! ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ _ ♪♪ This has been the besttime of my life, Churry. Okay, thanks, Rick! Y-You can turn him backinto a regular churro now. What? I-I can't turn him back. You asked me to bring him to life. Bam, done. But he's a churro, he doesn'thave internal organs, a brain, et cetera. In order to live, I had to makehim functionally immortal. What. _ My... My family! Goodbye, Churry. I'll miss you. These are just regular churros? Oh, my God, no! Mark my words, Morty! I shall leave you as you left me! On a barren planet! Praying for death! I'm starting to see whythis lawyer was free. Okay, well, we neverintentionally hurt people. Yeah, we adventure! Stuff goes wrong. We don't just m*rder for fun. Oh! Here's a clip about that topic! I did it, Morty! I k*lled the versions of usthat were in "Space Jam"! - Help me with the bodies!- Wow! - How you'd do it, Rick?- It was easy, Morty. Th-They welcomed death!They wanted out, Morty! No, no, no, you don'tget it, they begged me. - It was a kindness!- Was that helpful? It was for the prosecution! Okay, I've heard enough! No, you f*cking haven't. If we're about to die, at leastlet us defend ourselves. - Ahh, the outrage!- Ehh, seems iffy. I'll allow it. But no lollygagging! I only need one clip, Your Honor. If it pleases the court,hold on to your tits. [MURMURING] I'm a leg, Morty! You like that? Yeahhh, I know you do. Oh! We already saw that one. No, that's the other time I did it. That was your Hail Mary? - I held onto my tits for nothing!- Boooo! - That was mid!- Boo! I hereby find Rick and Morty guilty! Time to die! [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - What in tarnation?- Plot twist! Whattaya expect? You gaveme access to your tech. Look, I-I'm not saying we're heroes, but in the two minutes I'vehad access to your server, I can "observe" you're no better. Here, let's see a clip. Help! Please! Oh, my God! Please! Augh! Please! Absurd! If the Observer was in the clip, who was watching? Glad you asked! Please! Augh! Jesus Christ. You can't shame us for watching! It's who we are! Right, and you'd nevertake advantage of that. Hot copies! Freshly watched! I've got "Avatar" through ! Friends and Family screening,the VFX aren't done, but they're still blue! It's not my fault I saw those movies! Yes! We observe, it's all we do! Ohhoho! It's not all you do. I'll give you guys $to fight each other. Money, money! As it turns out, you do plenty! You're just as bad as us! We're not all bad. I observe a couple of bad apples! Who are you calling an apple? Should we all observe whatyou did with Tom's wife? Observe me harder! Harder! I regret nothing, Tom! The only thing you could never see was what a treasure Nancy was. - I'll k*ll you!- I'd like to observe you try! Geez, Rick. People be f*cking eachother's wives, huh? Marriage is a scam, Morty. Let's scram. Wait! I still have more clips! Morty, I appreciate whatyou were trying to do, with the punch cards,my whole groove thing. Thanks. So... is this a stamp? Or you gonna make me countthis as my adventure? How about we just ignore this one. Yeah. Yeah, good call. cents on the dollar? - .- Done. Whattaya say, Rick? Fly through space, come upon something, maybeI have a moral objection, stuff gets messy, and youultimately bail us out? L-Let's take it for a spin. Rick and Morty! We're back, baby! Check the glovebox! Whoa, another g*n! ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey, Morty, see you atthe frolf mixer tomorrow? Y-Yeah, sure thing, Jimmy. [SCREAMS] I knew this day would come... Oh, oh, God! Aaah! Nice.
