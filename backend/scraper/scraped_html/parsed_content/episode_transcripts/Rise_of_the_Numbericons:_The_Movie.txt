Why do you guys hate each other so much? Why do all teachers hateall students, Morty? Because you all breakour God damn hearts. Just seems like there'smore going on there. Was he that bad at math? No, Morty. Nobody is worse than you. The hurtful thing aboutyour friend back there is that at one point,it seemed like he might learn. [RAPPING OFFBEAT]I am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking, king of my jungle just agangster stalk stalking. Stalking. f*ck. Look at all thisnon-scholastic depravity! Reef-er, Cheetos, and not a smidgen of homework in sight! Yo, why you coming in heref*ck' up my words? Uh, T, maybe you oughtto go back to school. You can't keep a b*at to save your ass. Damn.

Maybe there's more to it. - Why bedtime?- What? He... He said it was a story you told lowercase letters at bedtime. Y-You never tell thestory during the day? I guess I just hopedthe phrase "bedtime" would make it easier to understand that lowercase letters areour version of children. Oh, so you did that for me? Well, half the people here are human. I didn't want to exclude you. We would have figuredout it was children. Yeah. Lowercase meanssmaller. We get it. Feels like I'm beingpunished for clarity. Punished? Jesus.

I won't let you take me alive! Have it your way. If you're going to actlike ignorant children, I guess the teacher's in charge. And, young lady, whoever toldyou numbers can't be emotional did you wrong. On Earth, numbers get down. Sometimes even with letters. Disgusting! Uh-huh. See? That's what everyone says. But then they go home and they typeall kinds of sh*t into p*rn. [SCRIBBLES SHOUTING] - Scribble! Jot jot!- Uh-oh! W-We're surrounded by primitive googas. - [GASPS]- Okay. The primitive googasworship the glowing thing. Things don't always resolve this fast. We're making good time. Scribble! Jot jot! Doodle! Doodle! We can't understand you.

And that's not an "I." - It's a one.- It's an "I." You guys don't get out much, huh? It seems kind of obvious that these Scribbles arelike the original species that letters and numbers came from. So that relic thing probablyisn't a one or an "I." I-It's probably just, like, a line. It's symbolic of thefact that your people don't need to be at w*r. - How do I know you again?- Get Schwifty. It's still nothing.So mind your damn business. At least we agree on that. Looks like your detentionis officially over. - Why?- You finally learned how hard it is to teach. - No, I didn't.- Then you... learned - how hard it is to learn.- I already knew. Just go to bed, you ungrateful sh*t! - Cock a doodle!- Cock a doodle two! The "I," it's gone! That bitch! 7 took the "I." - Come on, Mr. Goldenfold.- Count me out, Morty.

There must be some mistake.Try a different channel. The mistake was believingyou even knew Ice-T and could get me thatmath-loving youth vote. Now get out of here! I got a God damn presidentialcampaign to start. After that, my dreams fadedaway like so many erections. I mean, that sucks,but let's stop Sinistar-7, and maybe you two sortthis out on the way home?
