This article is a transcript of the Rick and Morty episode "Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri" from Season 4. It aired on May 31, 2020. [START "STAR MORT RICKTURN OF THE JERRI" TRANSCRIPT] ( Barrage of gunfire ) Get us out of here. I'll hold them off.  ( Screaming, zapping )  Space Beth: My name is Beth Smith. Tell your top bugs the Defiance lives on. I will. I will. I'll make you a legend. Blade Smith.  Space Beth: Beth Smith. Beth. Beth. Beth Smith. Okay, God, it's just such a plain... I'm trying to come up with a mnemonic device.  Space Beth: You could connect it to not dying. I know, I know! You think that would sear it right in, but it just speaks to the sheer forgettability. Oh, God. I-I-I'm, uh, so sorry. Uh, uh, oh, God. Starts with a "B"...  Congratulations to your government, business, or terror cell on its acquisition of the NX-5 Planet Remover by Xamaxax in partnership with Wrangler jeans. The NX-5's industry-leading tachyon beams eliminate planets twice as fast as the NX-4S with half the battery and zero built-in fatal design flaws. That's right. No more secret hole that blows the whole thing up when you shoot it. Your enemies will say it's unfair. We say it's about time.  Space Beth: Damn it. We risked our lives for that? You did your best.  Maybe you need a break. Don't you ever miss Earth?  Space Beth: I don't have to miss it. I'm technically still there. My dad made a perfect clone of me to take my place.  Boy, that Rick. So, if you do go back, what happens to the clone? Does it have, like, a proximity-triggered device in its neck?  Space Beth: Who cares? Are we done?  Sure. Unless you want me to remove the proximity-triggered device from your neck. Think it's a bomb? Man, what if this is how you found out he never wanted you back, that he loved the clone more than you? How crazy would that be? Crazy and of... of course soul-crushing. For you. I actually have something for that. Y-You want some? They're nonaddictive. That's not true. They're totally addictive. I'm a terrible doctor. I actually have something for that, too. You want some? Nonaddictive. Mmm. I'm a great doctor.   ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪  Beth: Dr. Wong had a cancellation today. Anybody up for a family session?  Summer: I could do that. I'm... I'm down to clown.  Jerry: Ooh, not sure my therapy puppet will be done in time.  Beth: Great, because she specifically asked you to stop bringing puppets. Dad?  Rick: I love therapy, family therapy most of all, but I am actually disintegrating. Whoa! Oh, my God! Dad!  Jerry: Is that really it? We did it? It's the invisibility belt. Whoa-whoa-whoa!  Rick: He grazed them. That's gonna hurt in like 10 seconds. Thanks, Morty. Why should I let you use it? You never let me use it. Can I have the belt? It would really piss off Morty. Fantastic idea. Morty: What the hell?! You jerk! Give it! Hey! Ow! Share the invisibility. Jerry? Ooh, this looks like a job for Mr. Nibbles. Let me just glue one more eye on. I'm gonna kill you!  Rick: Woof. Looks like you two have to fight about why you can't control your kids. Good thing Dr. Wong's got an opening. Bye.  Beth: You're a bad father.  Jerry: Don't let him divide us.  Rick: Garage, family therapy mode. Ah. Honey, you're back.  Space Beth: You seem surprised.  Rick: You never wrote.  Space Beth: And never exploded?  Rick: What I'm hearing is that you think that's a bomb.  Space Beth: So does every engineer that's seen it.  Rick: Engineer? Princess, I'm sure every caveman that sees a microwave calls it a rock cabinet. The point of inventing is to make things that don't exist. Space Beth: Then whip me up a reason not to kill you.  Beth: Dad? We're off to Dr. Wong's.  Rick: Scan her.  Beth: Dad?  Space Beth as Rick: Okay, have fun, pumpkin. Sorry I'm a piece-of-shit father.  Space Beth: Oh, ha-ha! Well, the self-loathing buys a lot back.   Beth: Jerry, leave the puppet.  Jerry: It's a one-way ticket to a breakthrough, Beth.  Rick: The device in her neck would have transferred a database of her memories to your device before vaporizing her. So much for that plan.  Space Beth: Why is she... it... why am I back with Jerry? I thought she was a copy of me.  Rick: She is a copy of you. If she ran back to that dingleberry, that's on you. Want to grab a drink?  Space Beth: All the time.  Rick: Good girl.  Ooh. ( Sniffing ) ( Beeping, whirring )  Morty: To catch a predator.  Summer: What the hell?!  Morty: Thermal goggles, bitch. Mom said share.  Summer: You can't share invisibility. Take those off. ( Grunting )  Morty: No.  Summer: So I'll just see you at cheerleader practice? Should I bring a poncho?  Morty: All right! State your terms.  Summer: Give back the belt. You take the goggles. Go away. We trade in an hour.  Morty: Deal. ( Glass breaks )  Summer: How do you like that, bitch?  Morty: Iliked it more than my old belt. "Tiny Big Man Junior"? You shoulda shared.  Random guy: What are you doing in my house?  Summer: Did I wander that far from my console? They should put a warning on these things.  Space Beth: So, we overrode the gates, and the slave rebellion took the capital. Pretty cool.  Rick: Very cool. My daughter, having space adventures. They are skewing a tad "Star Wars"-y, though. Don't forget to have fun.  Space Beth: Well, I came back to murder you, not get your notes, but I'll remember to fart more while I'm saving the galaxy.  Rick: Okay, I'm the one that made this possible. It's not a competition. Of course not.  Space Beth: Just curious, though, if it were, would "most wanted" be first place?  Rick: You're fighting the Gromflomites?  Space Beth: Dad, they're trying to take over the galaxy!  Rick: Everybody in the galaxy tries to take over the galaxy. The trick is to be left alone by whoever succeeds. Eh, it's your hero phase. I had one, too. You'll outgrow it.  Space Beth: No, you did. I'm not gonna outgrow giving a shit.  Sources tell us these aliens, who call themselves the Neeeew Galactic Federation, will blow up the planet unless some woman with a very boring name gives herself up.  Space Beth: Oh, come on.  Rick: Way to give a shit. Next time, don't wipe it on your home planet. Oh, shit. They're gonna track down Beth.  Space Beth: You mean... Beth's clone.  Rick: Right. Beth's clone. What... What did I say? It really was nice seeing you again.  Whoo! Yeah! Go, Honey Bees! Good practice, girls. And remember, we are in a drought, so be sure to shower as one big group at the exact same time. ( Alarm ringing ) Shower fire! The shower's on fire! Step aside, girls! I got this! ( Morty whimpering ) ( Alarm ringing within, morty whimpering ) ( Thud! )  Morty: You're a monster!  Summer: Still wanna share? ( Whooshing )  Morty Smith, hands up. You are under arrest for crimes against the New Improved Galactic Federation. Wait. What? How are you doing that? You're not a psychic, are you? Do you have psychic powers?  Morty: Uh, yes.  Are they strong powers? We're just looking for your mother. You can't, like, stop our hearts, can you?  Morty: Uh, I can.  Okay, we surrender.  Dr. Wong: Jerry, do you agree that the use of puppets makes you seem dumb and crazy?  Jerry: I don't think "crazy" is a responsible word to use in...  Dr Wong: It is now. This is crazy. You're being crazy.  Jerry: They do it in therapy on TV. Well,  Dr Wong: TV gives British people prizes for baking, Jerry. ( Boom! ) ( Ominous music )  Jerry: Tonya?  Beth: Tammy?  Jerry: Tammya? Tammya.  Tammy: Hi, Mrs. Smith. I like your hair better this way. How's the stomach?  Beth: What?  Jerry: Hey! I only said "hey." It's not like I can do more than that.  Tammy: As much as I'd like to kill you, my superiors have some questions about the Defiance.  Beth: I don't have a...  Beth: I have a Defiance? Oh, God, I'm a clone.  Tammy: That's your defense?  Beth: No, my defense is eat me.  Jerry: Hey! Ah! We've been over this. All I do is say "hey."  Rick: Smart guns, white-list human life. And the therapist. ( Blasting ) Tammy, this is the office where my family works to better itself.  Tammy: What, and that makes it sacred?   Rick: No, it makes it a place I've rigged with a lot of voice-activated escape contingencies. ( Clears throat ) These are all good points. I need to take a long look at myself.  Aah! Aah! Dr Wong: I'd like to discuss that.  Rick: I don't discuss problems, I incinerate them. Everybody in the car. Everybody in my family, not the world. Jesus, Wong. Boundaries.  Dr Wong: I'm better than this job.  Jerry' Can't you just make a portal? Rick: Your children are down there invisible, Jerry. "Make a portal"? Father of the year back here.  Beth: Well, you're one to talk. You told me I wasn't a clone.  Rick: Y-You're not a clone.  Beth: And who is that? Uh, uh, a clone.  Beth: Why would you make a clone of me just to send the clone into space?  Rick: Well, you didn't want to go, and I thought, "Okay, that's cool." But then I thought, "Well, you know what would be even cooler is a space daughter," s-so I made one. And I put a bomb in her neck in case she ever came back.  Jerry: Father of the year.  Rick: She wasn't supposed to come back.  Beth: Why did she?  Rick: Well, she found a bomb in her neck. Wouldn't you?  Jerry: Father of the year.  Rick: Shut up!  Beth: I'm tired of believing you. I want to talk to her.  Rick: No, you don't. Jerry, do something.  Jerry: Hey.  Beth: He told me you're the clone.  Space Beth: What do you think he told me?  Beth: You're the clone?  Space Beth: Wow, naive and attractive.  Beth: Wow, jaded and hot.  ( Rick grunting )  Rick: I know this is bad parenting, but if you stop fighting, you both get McDonald's.  Space Beth: How about I just blow my brains out, starting with hers?  Rick: Okay, Wendy's. We love Wendy's. I-I think they even gave us some money.  Tammy: Drop it. Don't move!    Freeze! Get down! On the ground! On the ground! Don't move!   Tammy: Everybody, shut up! You're all saying different shit. Wait, so there are two of them?    Jerry: More importantly, which one is mine?   Rick: Uh, neither, chauvinist.   Tammy: Whatever. Take them both. ♪ ♪   Rick: Cool beam. But let's bargain. I'm the one you really want.   Tammy: Excuse me?   Rick: Uh, smartest man in the universe? Secret to interdimensional travel? Ask your bosses.  Tammy: My bosses are bugs, Rick. You killed the old ones. The new ones are half my age. They know if you're left alone, you're a non-threat.   Jerry: Oofa!   Tammy: We got the payload. Fire up the NX-5. Earth's going Ta-ta. You might want to do that thing where you find a new universe where you can suck yourself off.   Rick: You can't tell me what to do.   Tammy: Awesome. He resisted. We can shoot him.   Jerry: Wha?i  Rck: Just go with it, Jerry. Everybody, drop your guns... except for Jerry! Fucking classic. ( Whooshing, gunfire ) Holy shit. Morty.   Morty: And Summer.   Morty: W-We worked together. That's... that's our arc.    Summer: We went from siblings to invisible to working together.    Morty: It's not "Citizen Kane," but why compete with whatever's going on here, you know?    Unh! ( Cracks ) Aah!   Rick: You made me go to a wedding. And you killed my best friend. I shoulda said that one first.   Congratulations, Earth, on being destroyed by the NX-5, brought to you by Wrangler. ( Zapping )   Rick: Ugh, guess the galaxy's most-wanted mammal needs her daddy to come change her diapie. Come on, kids, we have to go do a fucking piece of shit "Star Wars."   Attention, Zeta 99-2. We know you have a stolen ship. Stand down.    Rick: Oh, am I not a non-threat now?    ( Splatting, grunting )   Hey, you are not cleared to land. We will open fire. Hold your ground, men. You'll be heroes. ( Splat! )   Rick: Summer, try unlocking that door by scanning your high-school friend's dead face.   Jerry: Uh, I have... I have to pee.   Rick: Pee on the floor. It's a Death Star.   Jerry: Okay, but there's rebellion and then there's...   Summer: Here, Dad.   Jerry: Perfect.  ( Buzzing )   Summer: What am I doing wrong?   Rick: Ugh, her eyes are closed. Morty, open the left one. I've got the right. She died the way she lived, overserialized. I'm gonna rescue your mom and her clone without revealing which is which. You two find the NX-5 and shut it down. I mean, don't die trying. There's infinite Earths. If you can save this one, it's gravy.   Morty: Dream team rides again!   Summer: Oh, yeah, we're like Luke and Leia. Uh, except no kissing part. What's another famous brother-sister team?    Morty: Uh, Hansel and Gretel?   Summer: Yeah, right, those two were fucking. Dad, we need the belt.    Jerry: I can't go with you guys watching.   Morty: You're invisible.  Jerry: What if the pee isn't?   Morty: You know what? We don't need invisibility. Working together is our belt.   Summer: That's our arc. Let's do it. I'm gonna go ahead and whistle. That's how good I feel. ( Whistling )  Jerry: Oh, God. I knew it. Ugh, this floor isn't level.   Beth: Are they gonna torture us?   Space Beth: Unless you plan on telling them what I know. Last chance to guess who was the clone.   Beth: You're his daughter. Just something about the eyes, the shameless abandonment of your family. However can I live with myself?    Space Beth: One theory... I was designed by your father to live with myself, which would mean you made a conscious choice to swallow your dreams with cheap wine and dinosaur pasta.    Beth: You know that's the kind Jerry likes, same way I know the only goddamn dream you'll ever follow is your shitty father's approval.   Space Beth: You fetch your shitty father's lemonade.   Beth: You cosplay as your shitty father in his 30s.   Red alert. Red alert. Rick Sanchez...   ( Choking )   Rick: More like dead alert. What else? What else? I wrote some stuff down in my Notes app. Let me just find it. Screw it. Beth, if... if one of you is still alive, you're my real daughter. If you're both alive, don't hurt the other one. She's just a clone. She's not worth it. I'm coming, baby.   Space Beth: That piece of shit.   Bath: That piece of shit.   Space Beth: I came back kill him, you know.   Beth: I'd like to help.

Doesn't matter. If anyone's around, they're here to stop the laser, and they can't do it without us seeing them. "Working together is our belt"?    Morty: You gave it away!   Summer: You said we didn't need it. I wish you were never born.    Morty: You were an accident.    ( People screaming )   How come some of the pants are... The NX-5 can't destroy Wrangler jeans.
