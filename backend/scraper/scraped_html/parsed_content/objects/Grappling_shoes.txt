 Grappling shoes were an invention of Rick's that allowed the wearer to walk on any surface, regardless of the incline or texture.  History: Rick invented these shoes at some point prior to him and Morty travelling to Dimension 35-C in search of Mega Seeds. When they stumbled upon Mega Trees, Morty was told to put the grappeling shoes on and walk down the ledge. These shoes had to be turned on to work properly, as Morty found out the hard way when he slid down the cliff and broke his legs.  Rick and Morty kept these shoes on while going through Interdimensional Customs and used them to temporarily escape Gromflomites on foot by running up the wall of a building.
