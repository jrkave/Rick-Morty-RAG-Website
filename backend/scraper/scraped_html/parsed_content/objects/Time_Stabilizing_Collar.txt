The Time Stabilizing Collar is a device that merges multiple timelines into one. History: It was introduced in the episode "A Rickle in Time". After Rick's unsuccessful attempt to mend timelines together using a Time Crystal, a Fourth Dimensional Being appears and gives Rick, Morty, and Summer time stabilizing collars that successfully mend time back into a single timeline. At the end of the episode, Jerry makes fun of those wearing them, saying they look like "Power Rangers". Pocket Mortys:     Rick Around the Clock Appearances: "A Rickle in Time"
