 The Pink Sentient Switchblade is a pink sentient switchblade created by Rick Sanchez for his daughter Beth when she was a little girl. Beth had requested the switchblade along with a number of other horrific items. Beth later uses the switchblade to murder several Froopians when trying to bring Tommy back from Froopyland. Both she and the switchblade seemed to enjoy the experience. Trivia: When used by Beth, the switchblade says, "Born to stab!" However, in the subtitles, it says, "It's stabbing time!"
