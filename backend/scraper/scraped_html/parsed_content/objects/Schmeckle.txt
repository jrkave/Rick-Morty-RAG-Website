The Schmeckle is a form of currency in the Giants Dimension. History: It is encountered for the first time in the Thirsty Step in the episode "Meeseeks and Destroy". Rick and Morty's waitress says to other patrons that her breast augmentation cost 25 Schmeckles. This is also the price Slippery Stair asks for a ride down the stairs of the Giant Courthouse, as well as the amount Mr. Booby Buyer asks to buy the waitress' "boobies". Pocket Mortys: Schmeckles are the currency used in Pocket Mortys to buy items and are rewarded from winning battles. There always have been and always will be 500 Schmeckles in the world.  Appearances: "Meeseeks and Destroy" Trivia: The word "Schmeckle" sounds somewhat similar to "Shekel", which is the currency of Israel. A Schmeckle is worth approximately $148 USD. "Schmekel" is Yiddish slang for "penis". References â†‘ https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/202owt/we_are_dan_harmon_and_justin_roiland_creators_of/cfz82c0/
