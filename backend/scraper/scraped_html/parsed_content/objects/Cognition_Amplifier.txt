The cognition amplifier is created by Rick in "Lawnmower Dog" to make Snuffles smart, as demanded by Jerry. Initially the amplifier had one battery installed despite having the capacity to fit four batteries. When Snuffles discovered that his cognition amplifier had only one battery he installed 3 more batteries, which made the amplifier much more effective.
