The Multi-Phase Quantum Resonator, also known as a Defraculator, was a piece of technology that Rick once bought at a Pawn Shop. It had an unknown purpose, but it was probably communication, because the Clerk mentioned that "Earth only had cellphones". One of the functions was the ability to "defraculate". The model that Rick bought didn't have the ability to defraculate, so Rick called it a broken defraculator. The defraculator, as well as a Sex Doll, was bought for 60 smidgens.
