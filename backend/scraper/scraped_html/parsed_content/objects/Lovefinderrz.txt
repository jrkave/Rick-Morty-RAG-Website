 Lovefinderrz was an online dating application developed by Jerry Smith and Glootie. It scanned the user's face and matched them with another person not far away from them. The real intention behind the app was to distract humans and allow the Monogatrons to steal the Earth's water supply. Development: Glootie started developing the Lovefinderrz app when Jerry was the only one in the family to not resist his invitations to create an app. The two considered several names other than Lovefinderrz, such as: Ooh-La-Love, Cupidr, MeetLovers and WhoGotzDaLuv. Glootie created the app and launched it with Jerry's approval, before Morty found out to stop them. History: The Monogatrons sent Glootie to Earth with the sole intention of him developing an app to distract humans long enough for the Monogatrons to steal all the water on Earth. Rick Sanchez recognized the plan and tattooed Do not develop my app on Glootie's forehead to stop this plan, but still keep him around as his intern. Jerry, however, was intrigued by Glootie's idea for an app and together they made Lovefinderrz. The app proved incredibly successful, but when Jerry received a call from Beth Smith about an app with a dumb name, he asked Glootie to take the app down. Glootie informed Jerry that he could not do that, as he was merely an intern. After an unsuccessful escape attempt, Glootie agreed to take Jerry and Morty to the Monogatron ship and take down the app's servers.  On the ship they were told the real purpose of the app by the Monogatron leader and later put in a prison cell. Glootie returned to execute the father and son, but instead set them free when Jerry could sympathize with Glootie's loneliness. Glootie then went and put the app behind an ad wall, which prompted most users to delete it, stopping the Monogatrons' plan. Trivia: Lovefinderrz appears to be a parody of dating apps such as Tinder.
