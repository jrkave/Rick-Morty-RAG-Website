 History: After failing to ask Jessica to the upcoming school dance, Morty resolves to ask Rick for a potion to make Jessica fall in love with him. Rick refuses to do so, but later complies after Morty complains about how he always helps Rick, but never gets anything in return. Rick pulls out a vial of Oxytocin extracted from a vole which he mixes with one of Morty's hairs. He gives the potion to Morty with the instruction to smear it on whomever he wants to fall in love with him. Rick fails, however, to warn Morty of using it if Jessica has the flu.  At the Flu Season Dance Morty successfully smears the potion onto Jessica's arm, making her fall in love with Morty and dump Brad. Before Brad is taken away, he gets sneezed on by Jessica and also falls in love with Morty before himself sneezing into the punch bowl and into an air vent. Soon all attendees at the dance are madly in love with Morty. Rick saves Morty from the crowd of people and claims to be able to solve it all by releasing a solution made from praying mantis DNA into the air. This only leads to further problems by turning all humans on Earth into Mantis-people. Rick makes a second antidote made from the DNA of all living things, but this makes the situation even worse than ever before as it neutralizes the love potion's effects, but turns everyone into horrible, ugly-looking mutants Rick dubs Cronenbergs. Pocket Mortys:  Love Potion is a craftable item in the game Pocket Mortys.       The Love Ricktor Appearances: "Rick Potion #9" Trivia: This could be seen as a deconstruction of the love potion trope, as well as questioning the overall morality of using one on a person and pointing out its depravity, with Rick comparing it to slipping someone a roofie.
