Blemflarck, also known as galactic credits, are a centralised galactic currency, perused by the Galactic Federation. They became worthless in “The Rickshank Redemption”, where Rick sabotaged the currency to collapse the Galactic Federation. History: In the episode "Auto Erotic Assimilation", it is revealed that Rick was attempting to cure the Korblock alien Blim Blam of his space AIDS so he could patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarcks. In the episode "The Rickshank Rickdemption", Rick programmatically changes the value of the blemflarck from one to zero of itself to collapse the Galactic Federation. Blemflarck Crisis: After the currency's value was dropped to 0, the entire galactic Federation collapsed, causing its president to commit suicide. This led to all aliens to leaving Earth, and life for Gromflomites on Gromflom Prime to turn into hell; with hunger crisis and almost everything destroyed, including much of the residences previously on the planet.
