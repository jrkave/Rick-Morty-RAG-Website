The Morphizer-XE is a machine owned by Rick Sanchez and kept in The Garage. The origin of the device is unknown. Summer Smith found it and accidentally ended up as a skinless giant. Inside the machine was a small customer service team who would answer calls regarding the product. Function: The machine is built to change the appearance/structure of anything that is hit by its beam. It can enlarge and shrink an object or creature's body parts, turn its flesh inside out, or turn it into diamond. It also has a "normalize" function, which appears to change an object/creature to match its most prominent feature, like enlarge a person to match its largest body part. History: This machine was used by Summer Smith when she felt body shamed after Ethan chose to go on a camping trip with Tricia Lange, whose chest was larger than Summer's. She accidentally disproportionately expanded her body and got stuck inside of the garage until Beth Smith accidentally turned her into a giant before also turning her skin inside out and letting the customer service reps escape. Beth and Morty Smith brought the machine to Camp Flabanabba where Beth used the machine to match Summer and comfort her. Morty, however, used the machine on Ethan to punish him for dumping his sister. Trivia: The scene where this device was used on Summer is a reference to, and parody of, Lewis Carrol's Alice in Wonderland with the scene with Summer breaking the garage due to her growing size referencing Alice's decision to eat an "Eat Me" cookie in the White Rabbit's house and almost destroying the house in the process due to going to normal size. When the device turns both Summer and Beth into inside-out giants, this is clearly a reference to manga series Attack on Titan, as well as its anime adaptation.
