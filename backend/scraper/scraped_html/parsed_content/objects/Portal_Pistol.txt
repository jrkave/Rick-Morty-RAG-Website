 The Portal Pistol is a gadget that allows the user(s) to travel between different universes/dimensions/realities. The device was likely created by the Dinosaurs. It was able to function when normal portal travel was not working, and could produce portals that can be seen through, as opposed to the normally opaque portals produced by Rick's portal gun.
