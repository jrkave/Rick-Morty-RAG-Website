Mc Shave's Aftershave was one of the products sold at Needful Things in the episode "Something Ricked This Way Comes." Lucius Needful sells a bottle to Mr. Goldenfold after sensing that he longs for companionship from women. He claimed that the aftershave would make him irresistible to women, which it did. However, as with all products sold by Needful Things, it was cursed and made Mr. Goldenfold impotent. Luckily Rick developed an antidote that counteracted the negative affects, allowing Mr. Goldenfold to presumably have sex with the women he picked up with the aftershave.
