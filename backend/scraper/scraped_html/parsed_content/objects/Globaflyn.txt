Globaflyn is a chemical that, once consumed, seems to show a person the thing they want most. According to Rick's description, it "connects the whatever-you-have part of your brain with the whatever-you-want part of your brain". Rick keeps people he refuse to let into his life, but doesn't want to kill, in sacs filled with globaflyn, at sublevel B3 of his garage. Appearances: "The Old Man and the Seat" "Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation"
