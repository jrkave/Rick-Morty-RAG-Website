 Invisible Garbage Truck appeared in the credits scene of the Season 4 finale: "Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri". It was created by accident because of Jerry Smith throwing the Invisibility Belt into the trash. Jerry "befriends" the truck, most likely killing a pimp in the process. The Invisible Garbage Truck "dies" because it runs out of gas and Jerry being unable to find the fuel filler neck of it.
