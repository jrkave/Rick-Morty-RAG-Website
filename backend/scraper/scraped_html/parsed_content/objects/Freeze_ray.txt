The Freeze ray was one of Rick's devices. It could freeze organic targets until they became an icy statue. The effects were reversible but made the target extremely fragile and prone to shattering. History: In the "Pilot" Frank Palicky was killed when Rick froze him with the ray and he subsequently shattered when he was tipped over. The freeze ray can be seen in Rick's labcoat in "Lawnmower Dog." It was also shown in the beginning of "Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind" when one of the Ricks had to "neutralize the Jerry." Jerry was unfrozen when Rick requested they "at least unfreeze [his] daughter's idiot." It is used again by a Rick in "The Rickshank Rickdemption" to freeze Beth Smith Prime, Jerry Smith Prime and Summer Smith Prime. Rick also used it on Ned Flanders in the Simpsons and Rick and Morty crossover couch gag. When Rick and Morty flew off in the Shipsaucer, they accidentally knocked over Ned's frozen body, shattering him to pieces. Trivia: In a deleted scene the freeze ray would've appeared again in the episode, "Rixty Minutes," where a Rick came to visit human heart surgeon Beth after she reunited with movie star, Jerry of Dimension C-500A, on live television. Rick froze Jerry's body and watched it topple over and shatter in half in front of Beth. after seeing Jerry's police chase scene on television.
