 The Somnambulator is a device which programs the user's unconscious mind to perform tasks while they are sleeping. As is shown in Night Family, the Somnambulator can have dangerous adverse effects, including but not limited to the user's unconscious mind becoming sentient and attempting to take control of the host body. Trivia: It is unknown if the Somnambulator is able to provide energy to the sleeping bodies of its users once activated.
