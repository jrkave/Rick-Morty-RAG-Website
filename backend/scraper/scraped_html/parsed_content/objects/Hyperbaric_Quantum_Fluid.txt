Hyperbaric Quantum Fluid: Hyperbaric Quantum Fluid is a fluid possibly created by Rick to preserve clones of himself (and any other living organisms) for later use. Rick used the fluid to preserve his various clone bodies in "Big Trouble in Little Sanchez". While it preserves living tissue, according to Tiny Rick the bodies are still slowly dying while being inside the tanks with the fluid.
