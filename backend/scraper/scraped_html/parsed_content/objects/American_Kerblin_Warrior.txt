American Kerblin Warrior is a trans-planetary TV-show consisting of an obstacle course with two presenters commentating the events and The Kerblin as the main focus.  Structure: The show has two gleeful human presenters in the studio overlooking the course and the participants as they attempt to finish the challenges. The participant is first introduced to the audience watching before they set out on the course. The main obstacle, and main attraction, is The Kerblin; a huge sea monster lurking the water beneath the participants, which attacks and kills whoever tries to pass it.  History: In Rick and Morty Issue 28, Rick and Morty came across this TV-show while hiding from police on an unnamed planet. The contestant, Mike Dinklestein, was preparing to start while the presenters, Auggie and the other, told the audience about Mike's life leading up to this. Mike started out good, but was caught by The Kerblin and quickly chewed in half, much to the presenters' enjoyment.  Trivia: This is a parody of the show American Ninja Warrior. Site Navigation:
