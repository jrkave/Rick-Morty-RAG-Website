A Laser Hookah is device that is apparently used to either smoke or vaporize various substances. It appears in "The Rickchurian Mortydate". History: In "The Rickchurian Mortydate", Israel and Palestine announce a permanent ceasefire after signing the "Pretty Obvious If You Think About It" Peace Accord. Apparently, an anonymous American diplomat (Rick Sanchez) took them to a "Star Wars cantina" where they smoked "perspective-enhancing alien pheromones through a laser hookah." It is left to the viewer to decide whether the Hookah and its contents are a feature/fixture of the cantina itself (as the tube or cable protruding from the hookah might indicate) or whether it is one of Rickâ€™s toys that he brought with him as the Laser igniter/lighter appears to be. In any case, Rick appears to be familiar with the hookah in terms of both function and use.
