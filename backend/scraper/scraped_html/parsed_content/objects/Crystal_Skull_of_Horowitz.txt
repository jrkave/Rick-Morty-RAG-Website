The Crystal Skull of Horowitz was a highly valuable item stolen by Rick Sanchez through Heistotron by using Knightly's Eight. History: After recruiting Glar, Truckula and Angie Flint to enter Heist-Con, Rick intentionally left them to be recruited behind his back by Miles Knightly to steal the Crystal Skull of Horowitz, as part of Knightly's Eight. Once Knightly sent them to steal the skull, Heistotron shot them with darts and had them perform the heist on behalf of Rick instead. Once they had the skull and escaped in Truckula's truck, they handed it to Rick at Heist-Con and handed the bag full of shit to Knightly on stage.
