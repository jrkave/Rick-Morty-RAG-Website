 The Omega Device (Also known as The Weapon Too Cool For a Name or Booger Aids V2) is a weapon created by Rick Prime that is capable of permanently annihilating every variant of a certain individual from the multiverse if one variant is destroyed by it. Because of this, it is considered the most powerful and deadly weapon in the franchise. Rick Prime dubbed it The Weapon Too Cool For a Name, with Omega Device as its name known to inferiors, according to Rick Prime. In the past, Rick Prime used the Omega Device to kill every version of Diane Sanchez across infinity, but the device only worked once. Later, he created a second version of it without this fault. During the events of Unmortricken, Rick Prime tried to use it on every member of his family, but only managed to erase his uncle Slow Mobius. Evil Morty manages to scan the schematics of the device before destroying it, telling Rick C-137 and Morty Prime that he now has the ability to recreate it. However, Evil Morty decides not to use it for now, as using it would create a reputation for him as a multiversal threat, like Rick Prime was.  Trivia: The creators said through DVD commentary that at the end of Auto Erotic Assimilation Rick C-137 was going to kill not only himself, but all the synchronized Ricks in the Central Finite Curve through a similar light-yellow potion, possibly a prototype or component of the Omega Device. The only two characters to have been erased by this device are Diane Sanchez and Slow Mobius. Booger-AIDS is a name that Ricks tend to use as a placeholder.
