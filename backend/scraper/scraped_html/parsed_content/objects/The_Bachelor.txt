 The Bachelor is an American reality television dating game show that debuted on March 25, 2002, on ABC. The show is hosted by Chris Harrison. The Bachelor revolves around a single bachelor who starts with a pool of romantic interests, for whom the bachelor is expected to select a wife. History: In the episode "Rixty Minutes" the Smith Family was seen watching the final judgement episode of the show, and everyone was really interested in it, except for Rick. The Bachelor was seen misleading a girl named Cynthia into thinking the rose was for her, only for him to turn around and choose the other girl, Veronica, much to the dismay of Summer and the joy of Jerry. Beth was also appeased because she had "called it." Rick said that the show was stupid and later referred to it as fake.
