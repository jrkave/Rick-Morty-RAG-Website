The Brapple are three types of currencies used as a rating featured in "The Adventures of Stealy." These currencies are different from each other, but coincidentally they all have the same name. They coincidentally all have the color of light green in their designs too. The first Brapple shown resembles a green apple fused with a purple chicken drumstick; an (open) Bobbish chip bag is worth eight of these. The second Brapple shown resembles a chicken head, except at the bottom of the head are the feet, and both the beak and the claws are a light green, with the inside being shown to resemble a blue jelly; a Plumbus is worth six and a half of these.  The last Brapple shown resembles a purple fishlike creature with no fins, but limbs and three legs, with a red speedo, with the inside being shown to resemble a light green jelly. Three crushed SOLO party cups are worth fifteen and a half of these. In The Adventures of Stealy, a TV show from "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate," Stealy stole multiple items and were shown rating objects with their values with the corresponding Brapple.
