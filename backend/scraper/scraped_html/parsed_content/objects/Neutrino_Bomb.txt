The Neutrino Bomb is a powerful bomb invented by Rick Sanchez that could potentially wipe out all life on Earth and other planets. History: The Neutrino Bomb first appeared in the "Pilot" episode and presumably radiates lethal amounts of neutrinos when detonated. Because neutrinos can pass through matter almost unimpeded, a sufficient intensity of neutrinos will travel through the earth and deliver a lethal dose to the entire population in a fraction of a second. In a drunken stupor Rick planned to launch this bomb from his ship, intending to spare only himself, Morty, and Morty's crush Jessica. The bomb is shown arming itself but it is not known whether it detonates. In "Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender" it is revealed that Rick's neutrino bombs have a 40% chance to be duds and that Morty has disarmed several during Rick's drunken escapades. In "Rick and Morty Issue 22", Rick, depressed over his failure to defeat Doofus Jerry, attempted to detonate a Neutrino Bomb and be done with it. As he and Morty fought over the merits of the plan, Doofus Jerry casually revealed that he'd already disarmed the bomb, mocking them for thinking it would work against him. In "Rick and Morty Issue 45", Cronenberg Morty recruited Summer Smith Prime to help him retrieve the Space Cruiser and detonate its neutrino bomb to stop Cronenberg Rick and a council of evil Ricks from unleashing "Old God Rick". Seeing no future for herself, Summer took the ship on a suicide run and detonated the bomb, its yield now decayed to the point where it would only destroy the local observatory where the Ricks were based.
