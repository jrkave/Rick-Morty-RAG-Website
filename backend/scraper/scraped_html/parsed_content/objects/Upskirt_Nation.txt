Upskirt Nation is a five-time Bafta winning TV-show appearing in Rick and Morty Issue 28. It airs on the same channel as Police Boys. Premise: The show is a series of segments of photographs and videos taken under the skirts of unsuspecting women. History: While arguing over whether or not to keep watching Police Boys on interdimensional TV (which Morty was not a fan of), a preview for the night's episode of Upskirt Nation was shown and quickly caught Morty's interest. Rick, on the other hand, would rather let the murder in the episode of Police Boys stay a mystery than to keep watching TV from a creep dimension. Site Navigation:
