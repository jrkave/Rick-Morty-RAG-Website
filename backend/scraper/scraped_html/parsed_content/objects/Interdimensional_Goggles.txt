 The Interdimensional Goggles are a gadget created by Rick to observe realities across different dimensions by matching it to the wearer's DNA. History: The gadget was first shown in the episode Rick Potion No. 9 where he used them to find an alternate-reality he and Morty could go to after they Cronenberged their current reality. The goggles work by synching the user's eyes to the genetic code found across countless realities. When the user wears the goggles, they see their alternate dimension lives in the first-person. Later in Rixty Minutes, Rick would lend the goggles to Jerry, Beth and Summer. The goggles allowed Jerry and Beth to see what would happen to them had they aborted Summer. This results in a conflict with the three of them; Summer as a result threatened to run away from home. Morty would tell her what occurred in their real reality, resulting in the two siblings bonding. While Jerry and Beth became successful and fulfilled their dreams, they ended up missing each other.
