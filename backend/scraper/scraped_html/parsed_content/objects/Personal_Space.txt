 Personal Space is a low-budget TV-show hosted by Phillip Jacobs appearing in the episode Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate. It promotes the website www.personalspaceshow.com and is broadcast Tuesdays at 8 o'clock on BBC Two. Plot: Show host Phillip Jacobs is extremely concerned with his personal space and takes it very seriously. At times he's paranoid that someone is close to him, even though he is alone. After the intro he will direct the camera towards a projector and show slides saying "personal space", and telling the viewers to stay out of his personal space. At the end of the episode he removes his own skin on live TV. Production: Personal Space is shot in a poorly lit storage space, apparently operating on a very low budget. The intro is played on a portable cassette deck by the host. The show's remaining equipment is the camera used to record it, a wooden stool, wooden table, projector, and screen.   Trivia: Personal Space is broadcast before The Northsiders, which bears the BBC Two logo in the upper corner of the screen. BBC Two is a popular channel in the United Kingdom, suggesting that "Personal Space Show" airs on planet Earth. The English-accented narrator states "More Personal Space next Tuesday at 8. Up next, the heat is turning up for Samantha and the boys on 'The Northsiders'". It's possible 'The Northsiders' is a parody reference to EastEnders, which actually airs on BBC One. Site Navigations:
