The Poopeehedz is an intergalactic TV show featured in "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate". It was one of the early shows that Rick flipped past. It stars, what appears to be, creatures made of feces who crush each other's heads with a huge mallet on a high striker-machine. Trivia: The show appears to be a parody of comedian Gallagher's famous acts of smashing fruit on stage with an oversized mallet.
