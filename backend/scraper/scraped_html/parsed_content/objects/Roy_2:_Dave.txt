Roy 2: Dave is a Virtual Reality Life Simulator, a game at the Blips and Chitz arcade. It first appeared in "Mortynight Run" during the end-credits scene in a commercial for Blips and Chitz, and is a sequel to Roy: A Life Well Lived. The game's main character is Dave instead of Roy, which differentiates the game from its original release.
