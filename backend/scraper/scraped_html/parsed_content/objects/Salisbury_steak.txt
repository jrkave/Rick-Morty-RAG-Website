 Salisbury Steak is a dish that Rick Sanchez started providing for his family after they lost their appetite for Suicide Spaghetti. History: Near the end of "That's Amorte", Rick offered salisbury steaks to his family for the first time. Summer was still annoyed at the lack of spaghetti, but she and the others quickly appreciated the Salisbury steak, with Beth stating it is the best she ever tasted. Rick explained that the dishâ€™s origin was incredibly dark, to the point where anyone who finds out about it would likely kill themselves. However, the Smith Family learned their lesson from the spaghetti incident and decided to ignore it. Rick promised to never tell them, making the dish's origin a mystery.
