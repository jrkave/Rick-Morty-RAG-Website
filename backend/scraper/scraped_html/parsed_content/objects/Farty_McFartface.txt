 Farty McFartface is a yacht rock band in an unnamed dimension, who appeared on a talk show to promote their newest album, "Symphony in a Bottle". And while one of their songs is called "Love Whispers", the lyrics to all their songs appear to be "fart" in place of all words.  History: In "Rick and Morty Issue 28", Rick and Morty came across them while surfing through channels. While Rick immediately disliked the band, Morty was curious to hear their music. When the band started playing, they quickly changed the channel. Trivia: Farty McFartface is a reference to "Boaty McBoatface"; an incident when an online poll was published to decide the name of a new boat and someone added Boaty McBoatface as an alternative. The funny name gained a lot of traction and quickly received the most votes in the poll. Other notable variants are: "Horsey McHorseface" (an Australian racing horse), "Ferry McFerryface" (a ferry in Sydney) and "Schoolie McSchoolface" (a proposed new name for Robert E. Lee Elementary) Site Navigation:
