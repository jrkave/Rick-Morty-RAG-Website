 Blüd is a Federation-Grade Blood Substitute launched by the Galactic Federation on Earth. After taking control over Earth, the Galactic Federation set up a process for humans to replace all the blood in their body with Blüd, complimentary of the Galactic Federation of course. Blüd clots on the same level as blood and comes in a lot of different, fun colors to choose from.
