 The Solar Scepter is a traditional object created by inhabitants of The Sun. It was believed that this object was the gravitational center of the Solar System, with all celestial bodies revolving around it. In reality, that was a myth the Sun’s citizens made up as part of their religion. History: The Sun was sustainable enough so that a civilization of human-like citizens was able to develop and build a home on it. Those “Solarians” created a tradition where people who cut off their penises as a painful sacrifice would become Knights of the Sun, an important job for people who wanted to make sure the Solar Scepter was kept safe in the Sun, to maintain peace among the worlds. The object gained interplanetary fame, with its “power” being desired by the rulers of every planet in the Solar System. During the events of episode, Morty accidentally became the newest King of the Sun and the Knights started following him. During a conversation, one of the Knights explained to him how the Solar Scepter works. Morty, in return, used basic physics to explain how the object’s powers are made up and it is actually useless. The Knights, realizing they cut off their penises for nothing, gave up on their jobs and started seeking for heroin instead. Shortly after, the Sun was attacked by the Sons of the Moon. Rick and Morty went to the Neutral Zone, where the representatives of all planets were discussing the Sun/Moon conflict. After Morty revealed he has the Solar Scepter, a war began as all the representatives tried to get the object so they could rule the Solar System. The Knights of the Sun later reunited on the Sun and used their powers to send peace signals throughout the Solar System, while Rick brought the Solar Scepter back to where it belonged. Following Rick and Morty’s fake sacrifice, peace was restored in the Solar System and the Solarians ended their painful tradition. Navigation:
