 Nintendo 69 is a TV show on interdimensional cable. It appears in the episode "Mort Dinner Rick Andre."  Plot: The program appears to contain highly sexualized (possibly pornographic) content portraying a man having sex with a retro Nintendo Entertainment System wearing pink underwear whilst exclaiming "Nintendo, oooh what are you doing to me? Oooh Nintendo, oooh Nin-" before the TV was awkwardly switched off in shame. History: Morty invites Jessica into one of the rooms of the house and attempts to show her some interdimensional cable in a bid to keep her entertained while on a date, but promptly turns off the TV when he notices that she doesn't seem to be enjoying Nintendo 69. Trivia: Later in the same episode, Rick mentions to his arch-nemesis Mr. Nimbus that all he does is "...eat ass and 69 Nintendos bro [sic], every day". It was likely the most recent channel Rick Sanchez watched before it was carelessly shown to Jessica by Morty.The inclusion of the recliner chair's leg rest in a partially upright position may also hint that Rick finds the show arousing.
