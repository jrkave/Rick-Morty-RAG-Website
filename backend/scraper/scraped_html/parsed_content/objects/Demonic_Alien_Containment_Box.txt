The Demonic Alien Containment Box was used by Rick and Morty in the beginning of "Meeseeks and Destroy" to contain the detached demonic alien spirits from an alternate future that were possessing the clones of Jerry, Beth and Summer from an alternate reality. Trivia: The box bears a strong resemblance to the ghost traps featured in the Ghostbusters franchise.
