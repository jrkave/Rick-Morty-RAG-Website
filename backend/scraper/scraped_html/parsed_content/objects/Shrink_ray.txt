The Shrink ray was a complex device invented by Rick Sanchez that could shrink a human down to microscopic size. Functionality: As the name suggests, the shrink ray fires a green energy beam that can reduce the size of a subject to minuscule sizes, even to microscopic levels. It’s opposite, the growth/enlarge ray, on the other hand, increases a subject’s size to massive levels, even to the size of a planet. History: It was first introduced in the episode "Anatomy Park", where Rick used this to shrink Morty, so he could enter Ruben's body and save Dr. Xenon Bloom who was having difficulty with problems in Anatomy Park, located inside Ruben. The growth/enlarge rays appears twice later in the episode, one that was located inside of Ruben in the colon, and the other being one of the many weapons of Rick’s spaceship, when he uses it to enlarge Ruben, to the point where he was massive enough to practically cover the Earth from above.
